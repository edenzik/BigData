chapter
i.
down
the
rabbit-hol
alic
was
begin
to
get
veri
tire
of
sit
by
her
sister
on
the
bank,
and
of
have
noth
to
do:
onc
or
twice
she
had
peep
into
the
book
her
sister
was
reading,
but
it
had
no
pictur
or
convers
in
it,
and
what
is
the
use
of
a
book,
thought
alic
without
pictur
or
conversations?
so
she
was
consid
in
her
own
mind
(as
well
as
she
could,
for
the
hot
day
made
her
feel
veri
sleepi
and
stupid),
whether
the
pleasur
of
make
a
daisy-chain
would
be
worth
the
troubl
of
get
up
and
pick
the
daisies,
when
sudden
a
white
rabbit
with
pink
eye
ran
close
by
her.
there
was
noth
so
veri
remark
in
that;
nor
did
alic
think
it
so
veri
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
rabbit
say
to
itself,
oh
dear!
oh
dear!
i
shall
be
late!
(when
she
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occur
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wonder
at
this,
but
at
the
time
it
all
seem
quit
natural);
but
when
the
rabbit
actual
took
a
watch
out
of
it
waistcoat-pocket,
and
look
at
it,
and
then
hurri
on,
alic
start
to
her
feet,
for
it
flash
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
befor
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
it,
and
burn
with
curiosity,
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it,
and
fortun
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
larg
rabbit-hol
under
the
hedge.
in
anoth
moment
down
went
alic
after
it,
never
onc
consid
how
in
the
world
she
was
to
get
out
again.
the
rabbit-hol
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
way,
and
then
dip
sudden
down,
so
sudden
that
alic
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stop
herself
befor
she
found
herself
fall
down
a
veri
deep
well.
either
the
well
was
veri
deep,
or
she
fell
veri
slowly,
for
she
had
plenti
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
was
go
to
happen
next.
first,
she
tri
to
look
down
and
make
out
what
she
was
come
to,
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything;
then
she
look
at
the
side
of
the
well,
and
notic
that
they
were
fill
with
cupboard
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there
she
saw
map
and
pictur
hung
upon
pegs.
she
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelv
as
she
passed;
it
was
label
orang
marmalade',
but
to
her
great
disappoint
it
was
empty:
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
kill
somebody,
so
manag
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboard
as
she
fell
past
it.
well!
thought
alic
to
herself,
after
such
a
fall
as
this,
i
shall
think
noth
of
tumbl
down
stairs!
how
brave
they'll
all
think
me
at
home!
why,
i
wouldn't
say
anyth
about
it,
even
if
i
fell
off
the
top
of
the
house!
(which
was
veri
like
true.)
down,
down,
down.
would
the
fall
never
come
to
an
end!
'i
wonder
how
mani
mile
i'v
fallen
by
this
time?
she
said
aloud.
'i
must
be
get
somewher
near
the
centr
of
the
earth.
let
me
see:
that
would
be
four
thousand
mile
down,
i
think--
(for,
you
see,
alic
had
learnt
sever
thing
of
this
sort
in
her
lesson
in
the
schoolroom,
and
though
this
was
not
a
veri
good
opportun
for
show
off
her
knowledge,
as
there
was
no
one
to
listen
to
her,
still
it
was
good
practic
to
say
it
over)
--yes,
that
about
the
right
distance--but
then
i
wonder
what
latitud
or
longitud
i'v
got
to?
(alic
had
no
idea
what
latitud
was,
or
longitud
either,
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
word
to
say.)
present
she
began
again.
'i
wonder
if
i
shall
fall
right
through
the
earth!
how
funni
it'll
seem
to
come
out
among
the
peopl
that
walk
with
their
head
downward!
the
antipathies,
i
think--
(she
was
rather
glad
there
was
no
one
listening,
this
time,
as
it
didn't
sound
at
all
the
right
word)
--but
i
shall
have
to
ask
them
what
the
name
of
the
countri
is,
you
know.
please,
ma'am,
is
this
new
zealand
or
australia?
(and
she
tri
to
curtsey
as
she
spoke--f
curtsey
as
you'r
fall
through
the
air!
do
you
think
you
could
manag
it?)
and
what
an
ignor
littl
girl
she'll
think
me
for
asking!
no,
it'll
never
do
to
ask:
perhap
i
shall
see
it
written
up
somewhere.
down,
down,
down.
there
was
noth
els
to
do,
so
alic
soon
began
talk
again.
dinah'l
miss
me
veri
much
to-night,
i
should
think!
(dinah
was
the
cat.)
'i
hope
they'll
rememb
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea-time.
dinah
my
dear!
i
wish
you
were
down
here
with
me!
there
are
no
mice
in
the
air,
i'm
afraid,
but
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that
veri
like
a
mouse,
you
know.
but
do
cat
eat
bats,
i
wonder?
and
here
alic
began
to
get
rather
sleepy,
and
went
on
say
to
herself,
in
a
dreami
sort
of
way,
do
cat
eat
bats?
do
cat
eat
bats?
and
sometimes,
do
bat
eat
cats?
for,
you
see,
as
she
couldn't
answer
either
question,
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
she
put
it.
she
felt
that
she
was
doze
off,
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
walk
hand
in
hand
with
dinah,
and
say
to
her
veri
earnestly,
now,
dinah,
tell
me
the
truth:
did
you
ever
eat
a
bat?
when
suddenly,
thump!
thump!
down
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
stick
and
dri
leaves,
and
the
fall
was
over.
alic
was
not
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
jump
up
on
to
her
feet
in
a
moment:
she
look
up,
but
it
was
all
dark
overhead;
befor
her
was
anoth
long
passage,
and
the
white
rabbit
was
still
in
sight,
hurri
down
it.
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost:
away
went
alic
like
the
wind,
and
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
say,
as
it
turn
a
corner,
oh
my
ear
and
whiskers,
how
late
it
getting!
she
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turn
the
corner,
but
the
rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
seen:
she
found
herself
in
a
long,
low
hall,
which
was
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamp
hang
from
the
roof.
there
were
door
all
round
the
hall,
but
they
were
all
locked;
and
when
alic
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
other,
tri
everi
door,
she
walk
sad
down
the
middle,
wonder
how
she
was
ever
to
get
out
again.
sudden
she
came
upon
a
littl
three-leg
table,
all
made
of
solid
glass;
there
was
noth
on
it
except
a
tini
golden
key,
and
alic
first
thought
was
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
door
of
the
hall;
but,
alas!
either
the
lock
were
too
large,
or
the
key
was
too
small,
but
at
ani
rate
it
would
not
open
ani
of
them.
however,
on
the
second
time
round,
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
notic
before,
and
behind
it
was
a
littl
door
about
fifteen
inch
high:
she
tri
the
littl
golden
key
in
the
lock,
and
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted!
alic
open
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
passage,
not
much
larger
than
a
rat-hole:
she
knelt
down
and
look
along
the
passag
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
saw.
how
she
long
to
get
out
of
that
dark
hall,
and
wander
about
among
those
bed
of
bright
flower
and
those
cool
fountains,
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
doorway;
and
even
if
my
head
would
go
through,
thought
poor
alice,
it
would
be
of
veri
littl
use
without
my
shoulders.
oh,
how
i
wish
i
could
shut
up
like
a
telescope!
i
think
i
could,
if
i
onli
knew
how
to
begin.
for,
you
see,
so
mani
out-of-the-way
thing
had
happen
lately,
that
alic
had
begun
to
think
that
veri
few
thing
inde
were
realli
impossible.
there
seem
to
be
no
use
in
wait
by
the
littl
door,
so
she
went
back
to
the
table,
half
hope
she
might
find
anoth
key
on
it,
or
at
ani
rate
a
book
of
rule
for
shut
peopl
up
like
telescopes:
this
time
she
found
a
littl
bottl
on
it,
('which
certain
was
not
here
before,
said
alice,)
and
round
the
neck
of
the
bottl
was
a
paper
label,
with
the
word
drink
me
beauti
print
on
it
in
larg
letters.
it
was
all
veri
well
to
say
drink
me,
but
the
wise
littl
alic
was
not
go
to
do
that
in
a
hurry.
no,
i'll
look
first,
she
said,
and
see
whether
it
mark
"poison"
or
not';
for
she
had
read
sever
nice
littl
histori
about
children
who
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
wild
beast
and
other
unpleas
things,
all
becaus
they
would
not
rememb
the
simpl
rule
their
friend
had
taught
them:
such
as,
that
a
red-hot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
long;
and
that
if
you
cut
your
finger
veri
deepli
with
a
knife,
it
usual
bleeds;
and
she
had
never
forgotten
that,
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottl
mark
poison,
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagre
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
however,
this
bottl
was
not
mark
poison,
so
alic
ventur
to
tast
it,
and
find
it
veri
nice,
(it
had,
in
fact,
a
sort
of
mix
flavour
of
cherry-tart,
custard,
pine-apple,
roast
turkey,
toffee,
and
hot
butter
toast,)
she
veri
soon
finish
it
off.

what
a
curious
feeling!
said
alice;
'i
must
be
shut
up
like
a
telescope.
and
so
it
was
indeed:
she
was
now
onli
ten
inch
high,
and
her
face
brighten
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
go
through
the
littl
door
into
that
love
garden.
first,
however,
she
wait
for
a
few
minut
to
see
if
she
was
go
to
shrink
ani
further:
she
felt
a
littl
nervous
about
this;
for
it
might
end,
you
know,
said
alic
to
herself,
in
my
go
out
altogether,
like
a
candle.
i
wonder
what
i
should
be
like
then?
and
she
tri
to
fanci
what
the
flame
of
a
candl
is
like
after
the
candl
is
blown
out,
for
she
could
not
rememb
ever
have
seen
such
a
thing.
after
a
while,
find
that
noth
more
happened,
she
decid
on
go
into
the
garden
at
once;
but,
ala
for
poor
alice!
when
she
got
to
the
door,
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
littl
golden
key,
and
when
she
went
back
to
the
tabl
for
it,
she
found
she
could
not
possibl
reach
it:
she
could
see
it
quit
plain
through
the
glass,
and
she
tri
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
leg
of
the
table,
but
it
was
too
slippery;
and
when
she
had
tire
herself
out
with
trying,
the
poor
littl
thing
sat
down
and
cried.
come,
there
no
use
in
cri
like
that!
said
alic
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
'i
advis
you
to
leav
off
this
minute!
she
general
gave
herself
veri
good
advice,
(though
she
veri
seldom
follow
it),
and
sometim
she
scold
herself
so
sever
as
to
bring
tear
into
her
eyes;
and
onc
she
rememb
tri
to
box
her
own
ear
for
have
cheat
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
play
against
herself,
for
this
curious
child
was
veri
fond
of
pretend
to
be
two
people.
but
it
no
use
now,
thought
poor
alice,
to
pretend
to
be
two
people!
why,
there
hard
enough
of
me
left
to
make
one
respect
person!
soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
littl
glass
box
that
was
lie
under
the
table:
she
open
it,
and
found
in
it
a
veri
small
cake,
on
which
the
word
eat
me
were
beauti
mark
in
currants.
well,
i'll
eat
it,
said
alice,
and
if
it
make
me
grow
larger,
i
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
it
make
me
grow
smaller,
i
can
creep
under
the
door;
so
either
way
i'll
get
into
the
garden,
and
i
don't
care
which
happens!
she
ate
a
littl
bit,
and
said
anxious
to
herself,
which
way?
which
way?',
hold
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
was
growing,
and
she
was
quit
surpris
to
find
that
she
remain
the
same
size:
to
be
sure,
this
general
happen
when
one
eat
cake,
but
alic
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expect
noth
but
out-of-the-way
thing
to
happen,
that
it
seem
quit
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
on
in
the
common
way.
so
she
set
to
work,
and
veri
soon
finish
off
the
cake.

chapter
ii.
the
pool
of
tear
curious
and
curiouser!
cri
alic
(she
was
so
much
surprised,
that
for
the
moment
she
quit
forgot
how
to
speak
good
english);
now
i'm
open
out
like
the
largest
telescop
that
ever
was!
good-bye,
feet!
(for
when
she
look
down
at
her
feet,
they
seem
to
be
almost
out
of
sight,
they
were
get
so
far
off).
oh,
my
poor
littl
feet,
i
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoe
and
stock
for
you
now,
dears?
i'm
sure
_i_
shan't
be
able!
i
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
troubl
myself
about
you:
you
must
manag
the
best
way
you
can;--but
i
must
be
kind
to
them,
thought
alice,
or
perhap
they
won't
walk
the
way
i
want
to
go!
let
me
see:
i'll
give
them
a
new
pair
of
boot
everi
christmas.
and
she
went
on
plan
to
herself
how
she
would
manag
it.
they
must
go
by
the
carrier,
she
thought;
and
how
funni
it'll
seem,
send
present
to
one
own
feet!
and
how
odd
the
direct
will
look!
alic
right
foot,
esq.
hearthrug,
near
the
fender,
(with
alic
love).
oh
dear,
what
nonsens
i'm
talking!
just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
hall:
in
fact
she
was
now
more
than
nine
feet
high,
and
she
at
onc
took
up
the
littl
golden
key
and
hurri
off
to
the
garden
door.
poor
alice!
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do,
lie
down
on
one
side,
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye;
but
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless
than
ever:
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cri
again.
you
ought
to
be
asham
of
yourself,
said
alice,
'a
great
girl
like
you,
(she
might
well
say
this),
to
go
on
cri
in
this
way!
stop
this
moment,
i
tell
you!
but
she
went
on
all
the
same,
shed
gallon
of
tears,
until
there
was
a
larg
pool
all
round
her,
about
four
inch
deep
and
reach
half
down
the
hall.
after
a
time
she
heard
a
littl
patter
of
feet
in
the
distance,
and
she
hastili
dri
her
eye
to
see
what
was
coming.
it
was
the
white
rabbit
returning,
splendid
dressed,
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
glove
in
one
hand
and
a
larg
fan
in
the
other:
he
came
trot
along
in
a
great
hurry,
mutter
to
himself
as
he
came,
oh!
the
duchess,
the
duchess!
oh!
won't
she
be
savag
if
i'v
kept
her
waiting!
alic
felt
so
desper
that
she
was
readi
to
ask
help
of
ani
one;
so,
when
the
rabbit
came
near
her,
she
began,
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
if
you
please,
sir--
the
rabbit
start
violently,
drop
the
white
kid
glove
and
the
fan,
and
skurri
away
into
the
dark
as
hard
as
he
could
go.
alic
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves,
and,
as
the
hall
was
veri
hot,
she
kept
fan
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
talking:
dear,
dear!
how
queer
everyth
is
to-day!
and
yesterday
thing
went
on
just
as
usual.
i
wonder
if
i'v
been
chang
in
the
night?
let
me
think:
was
i
the
same
when
i
got
up
this
morning?
i
almost
think
i
can
rememb
feel
a
littl
different.
but
if
i'm
not
the
same,
the
next
question
is,
who
in
the
world
am
i?
ah,
that
the
great
puzzle!
and
she
began
think
over
all
the
children
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
as
herself,
to
see
if
she
could
have
been
chang
for
ani
of
them.
i'm
sure
i'm
not
ada,
she
said,
for
her
hair
goe
in
such
long
ringlets,
and
mine
doesn't
go
in
ringlet
at
all;
and
i'm
sure
i
can't
be
mabel,
for
i
know
all
sort
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
know
such
a
veri
little!
besides,
she
she,
and
i'm
i,
and--oh
dear,
how
puzzl
it
all
is!
i'll
tri
if
i
know
all
the
thing
i
use
to
know.
let
me
see:
four
time
five
is
twelve,
and
four
time
six
is
thirteen,
and
four
time
seven
is--oh
dear!
i
shall
never
get
to
twenti
at
that
rate!
however,
the
multipl
tabl
doesn't
signify:
let
tri
geography.
london
is
the
capit
of
paris,
and
pari
is
the
capit
of
rome,
and
rome--no,
that
all
wrong,
i'm
certain!
i
must
have
been
chang
for
mabel!
i'll
tri
and
say
"how
doth
the
little--"
and
she
cross
her
hand
on
her
lap
as
if
she
were
say
lessons,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
voic
sound
hoars
and
strange,
and
the
word
did
not
come
the
same
as
they
use
to
do:--
how
doth
the
littl
crocodil
improv
his
shine
tail,
and
pour
the
water
of
the
nile
on
everi
golden
scale!
how
cheer
he
seem
to
grin,
how
neat
spread
his
claws,
and
welcom
littl
fish
in
with
gentl
smile
jaws!
i'm
sure
those
are
not
the
right
words,
said
poor
alice,
and
her
eye
fill
with
tear
again
as
she
went
on,
'i
must
be
mabel
after
all,
and
i
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
poki
littl
house,
and
have
next
to
no
toy
to
play
with,
and
oh!
ever
so
mani
lesson
to
learn!
no,
i'v
made
up
my
mind
about
it;
if
i'm
mabel,
i'll
stay
down
here!
it'll
be
no
use
their
put
their
head
down
and
say
"come
up
again,
dear!"
i
shall
onli
look
up
and
say
"who
am
i
then?
tell
me
that
first,
and
then,
if
i
like
be
that
person,
i'll
come
up:
if
not,
i'll
stay
down
here
till
i'm
somebodi
else"--but,
oh
dear!
cri
alice,
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
'i
do
wish
they
would
put
their
head
down!
i
am
so
veri
tire
of
be
all
alon
here!
as
she
said
this
she
look
down
at
her
hands,
and
was
surpris
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
rabbit
littl
white
kid
glove
while
she
was
talking.
how
can
i
have
done
that?
she
thought.
'i
must
be
grow
small
again.
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
tabl
to
measur
herself
by
it,
and
found
that,
as
near
as
she
could
guess,
she
was
now
about
two
feet
high,
and
was
go
on
shrink
rapidly:
she
soon
found
out
that
the
caus
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
holding,
and
she
drop
it
hastily,
just
in
time
to
avoid
shrink
away
altogether.
that
was
a
narrow
escape!
said
alice,
a
good
deal
frighten
at
the
sudden
change,
but
veri
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
existence;
and
now
for
the
garden!
and
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
littl
door:
but,
alas!
the
littl
door
was
shut
again,
and
the
littl
golden
key
was
lie
on
the
glass
tabl
as
before,
and
thing
are
wors
than
ever,
thought
the
poor
child,
for
i
never
was
so
small
as
this
before,
never!
and
i
declar
it
too
bad,
that
it
is!
as
she
said
these
word
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
anoth
moment,
splash!
she
was
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
water.
her
first
idea
was
that
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
sea,
and
in
that
case
i
can
go
back
by
railway,
she
said
to
herself.
(alic
had
been
to
the
seasid
onc
in
her
life,
and
had
come
to
the
general
conclusion,
that
wherev
you
go
to
on
the
english
coast
you
find
a
number
of
bath
machin
in
the
sea,
some
children
dig
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then
a
row
of
lodg
houses,
and
behind
them
a
railway
station.)
however,
she
soon
made
out
that
she
was
in
the
pool
of
tear
which
she
had
wept
when
she
was
nine
feet
high.
'i
wish
i
hadn't
cri
so
much!
said
alice,
as
she
swam
about,
tri
to
find
her
way
out.
'i
shall
be
punish
for
it
now,
i
suppose,
by
be
drown
in
my
own
tears!
that
will
be
a
queer
thing,
to
be
sure!
however,
everyth
is
queer
to-day.
just
then
she
heard
someth
splash
about
in
the
pool
a
littl
way
off,
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
was:
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus,
but
then
she
rememb
how
small
she
was
now,
and
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
onli
a
mous
that
had
slip
in
like
herself.
would
it
be
of
ani
use,
now,
thought
alice,
to
speak
to
this
mouse?
everyth
is
so
out-of-the-way
down
here,
that
i
should
think
veri
like
it
can
talk:
at
ani
rate,
there
no
harm
in
trying.
so
she
began:
'o
mouse,
do
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
pool?
i
am
veri
tire
of
swim
about
here,
o
mouse!
(alic
thought
this
must
be
the
right
way
of
speak
to
a
mouse:
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before,
but
she
rememb
have
seen
in
her
brother
latin
grammar,
'a
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--o
mouse!')
the
mous
look
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seem
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
it
littl
eyes,
but
it
said
nothing.
perhap
it
doesn't
understand
english,
thought
alice;
'i
daresay
it
a
french
mouse,
come
over
with
william
the
conqueror.
(for,
with
all
her
knowledg
of
history,
alic
had
no
veri
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anyth
had
happened.)
so
she
began
again:
ou
est
ma
chatte?
which
was
the
first
sentenc
in
her
french
lesson-book.
the
mous
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
water,
and
seem
to
quiver
all
over
with
fright.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon!
cri
alic
hastily,
afraid
that
she
had
hurt
the
poor
anim
feelings.
'i
quit
forgot
you
didn't
like
cats.
not
like
cats!
cri
the
mouse,
in
a
shrill,
passion
voice.
would
you
like
cat
if
you
were
me?
well,
perhap
not,
said
alic
in
a
sooth
tone:
don't
be
angri
about
it.
and
yet
i
wish
i
could
show
you
our
cat
dinah:
i
think
you'd
take
a
fanci
to
cat
if
you
could
onli
see
her.
she
is
such
a
dear
quiet
thing,
alic
went
on,
half
to
herself,
as
she
swam
lazili
about
in
the
pool,
and
she
sit
pur
so
nice
by
the
fire,
lick
her
paw
and
wash
her
face--and
she
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
nurse--and
she
such
a
capit
one
for
catch
mice--oh,
i
beg
your
pardon!
cri
alic
again,
for
this
time
the
mous
was
bristl
all
over,
and
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
realli
offended.
we
won't
talk
about
her
ani
more
if
you'd
rather
not.
we
indeed!
cri
the
mouse,
who
was
trembl
down
to
the
end
of
his
tail.
as
if
i
would
talk
on
such
a
subject!
our
famili
alway
hate
cats:
nasty,
low,
vulgar
things!
don't
let
me
hear
the
name
again!
'i
won't
indeed!
said
alice,
in
a
great
hurri
to
chang
the
subject
of
conversation.
are
you--ar
you
fond--of--of
dogs?
the
mous
did
not
answer,
so
alic
went
on
eagerly:
there
is
such
a
nice
littl
dog
near
our
hous
i
should
like
to
show
you!
a
littl
bright-ey
terrier,
you
know,
with
oh,
such
long
cur
brown
hair!
and
it'll
fetch
thing
when
you
throw
them,
and
it'll
sit
up
and
beg
for
it
dinner,
and
all
sort
of
things--i
can't
rememb
half
of
them--and
it
belong
to
a
farmer,
you
know,
and
he
say
it
so
useful,
it
worth
a
hundr
pounds!
he
say
it
kill
all
the
rat
and--oh
dear!
cri
alic
in
a
sorrow
tone,
i'm
afraid
i'v
offend
it
again!
for
the
mous
was
swim
away
from
her
as
hard
as
it
could
go,
and
make
quit
a
commot
in
the
pool
as
it
went.
so
she
call
soft
after
it,
mous
dear!
do
come
back
again,
and
we
won't
talk
about
cat
or
dog
either,
if
you
don't
like
them!
when
the
mous
heard
this,
it
turn
round
and
swam
slowli
back
to
her:
it
face
was
quit
pale
(with
passion,
alic
thought),
and
it
said
in
a
low
trembl
voice,
let
us
get
to
the
shore,
and
then
i'll
tell
you
my
history,
and
you'll
understand
whi
it
is
i
hate
cat
and
dogs.
it
was
high
time
to
go,
for
the
pool
was
get
quit
crowd
with
the
bird
and
anim
that
had
fallen
into
it:
there
were
a
duck
and
a
dodo,
a
lori
and
an
eaglet,
and
sever
other
curious
creatures.
alic
led
the
way,
and
the
whole
parti
swam
to
the
shore.
chapter
iii.
a
caucus-rac
and
a
long
tale
they
were
inde
a
queer-look
parti
that
assembl
on
the
bank--th
bird
with
draggl
feathers,
the
anim
with
their
fur
cling
close
to
them,
and
all
drip
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
the
first
question
of
cours
was,
how
to
get
dri
again:
they
had
a
consult
about
this,
and
after
a
few
minut
it
seem
quit
natur
to
alic
to
find
herself
talk
familiar
with
them,
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life.
indeed,
she
had
quit
a
long
argument
with
the
lory,
who
at
last
turn
sulky,
and
would
onli
say,
'i
am
older
than
you,
and
must
know
better';
and
this
alic
would
not
allow
without
know
how
old
it
was,
and,
as
the
lori
posit
refus
to
tell
it
age,
there
was
no
more
to
be
said.
at
last
the
mouse,
who
seem
to
be
a
person
of
author
among
them,
call
out,
sit
down,
all
of
you,
and
listen
to
me!
i'll
soon
make
you
dri
enough!
they
all
sat
down
at
once,
in
a
larg
ring,
with
the
mous
in
the
middle.
alic
kept
her
eye
anxious
fix
on
it,
for
she
felt
sure
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
did
not
get
dri
veri
soon.
ahem!
said
the
mous
with
an
import
air,
are
you
all
ready?
this
is
the
driest
thing
i
know.
silenc
all
round,
if
you
please!
"william
the
conqueror,
whose
caus
was
favour
by
the
pope,
was
soon
submit
to
by
the
english,
who
want
leaders,
and
had
been
of
late
much
accustom
to
usurp
and
conquest.
edwin
and
morcar,
the
earl
of
mercia
and
northumbria--"
ugh!
said
the
lory,
with
a
shiver.
'i
beg
your
pardon!
said
the
mouse,
frowning,
but
veri
politely:
did
you
speak?
not
i!
said
the
lori
hastily.
'i
thought
you
did,
said
the
mouse.
--i
proceed.
"edwin
and
morcar,
the
earl
of
mercia
and
northumbria,
declar
for
him:
and
even
stigand,
the
patriot
archbishop
of
canterbury,
found
it
advisable--"
found
what?
said
the
duck.
found
it,
the
mous
repli
rather
crossly:
of
cours
you
know
what
"it"
means.
'i
know
what
"it"
mean
well
enough,
when
i
find
a
thing,
said
the
duck:
it
general
a
frog
or
a
worm.
the
question
is,
what
did
the
archbishop
find?
the
mous
did
not
notic
this
question,
but
hurri
went
on,
"--found
it
advis
to
go
with
edgar
athel
to
meet
william
and
offer
him
the
crown.
william
conduct
at
first
was
moderate.
but
the
insol
of
his
normans--"
how
are
you
get
on
now,
my
dear?
it
continued,
turn
to
alic
as
it
spoke.
as
wet
as
ever,
said
alic
in
a
melancholi
tone:
it
doesn't
seem
to
dri
me
at
all.
in
that
case,
said
the
dodo
solemnly,
rise
to
it
feet,
'i
move
that
the
meet
adjourn,
for
the
immedi
adopt
of
more
energet
remedies--
speak
english!
said
the
eaglet.
'i
don't
know
the
mean
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what
more,
i
don't
believ
you
do
either!
and
the
eaglet
bent
down
it
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
the
other
bird
titter
audibly.
what
i
was
go
to
say,
said
the
dodo
in
an
offend
tone,
was,
that
the
best
thing
to
get
us
dri
would
be
a
caucus-race.
what
is
a
caucus-race?
said
alice;
not
that
she
want
much
to
know,
but
the
dodo
had
paus
as
if
it
thought
that
somebodi
ought
to
speak,
and
no
one
els
seem
inclin
to
say
anything.
why,
said
the
dodo,
the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
it.
(and,
as
you
might
like
to
tri
the
thing
yourself,
some
winter
day,
i
will
tell
you
how
the
dodo
manag
it.)
first
it
mark
out
a
race-course,
in
a
sort
of
circle,
('the
exact
shape
doesn't
matter,
it
said,)
and
then
all
the
parti
were
place
along
the
course,
here
and
there.
there
was
no
one,
two,
three,
and
away,
but
they
began
run
when
they
liked,
and
left
off
when
they
liked,
so
that
it
was
not
easi
to
know
when
the
race
was
over.
however,
when
they
had
been
run
half
an
hour
or
so,
and
were
quit
dri
again,
the
dodo
sudden
call
out
the
race
is
over!
and
they
all
crowd
round
it,
panting,
and
asking,
but
who
has
won?
this
question
the
dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
it
sat
for
a
long
time
with
one
finger
press
upon
it
forehead
(the
posit
in
which
you
usual
see
shakespeare,
in
the
pictur
of
him),
while
the
rest
wait
in
silence.
at
last
the
dodo
said,
everybodi
has
won,
and
all
must
have
prizes.
but
who
is
to
give
the
prizes?
quit
a
chorus
of
voic
asked.
why,
she,
of
course,
said
the
dodo,
point
to
alic
with
one
finger;
and
the
whole
parti
at
onc
crowd
round
her,
call
out
in
a
confus
way,
prizes!
prizes!
alic
had
no
idea
what
to
do,
and
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket,
and
pull
out
a
box
of
comfits,
(luckili
the
salt
water
had
not
got
into
it),
and
hand
them
round
as
prizes.
there
was
exact
one
a-piec
all
round.
but
she
must
have
a
prize
herself,
you
know,
said
the
mouse.
of
course,
the
dodo
repli
veri
gravely.
what
els
have
you
got
in
your
pocket?
he
went
on,
turn
to
alice.
on
a
thimble,
said
alic
sadly.
hand
it
over
here,
said
the
dodo.
then
they
all
crowd
round
her
onc
more,
while
the
dodo
solemn
present
the
thimble,
say
we
beg
your
accept
of
this
eleg
thimble';
and,
when
it
had
finish
this
short
speech,
they
all
cheered.
alic
thought
the
whole
thing
veri
absurd,
but
they
all
look
so
grave
that
she
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
she
could
not
think
of
anyth
to
say,
she
simpli
bowed,
and
took
the
thimble,
look
as
solemn
as
she
could.
the
next
thing
was
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caus
some
nois
and
confusion,
as
the
larg
bird
complain
that
they
could
not
tast
theirs,
and
the
small
one
choke
and
had
to
be
pat
on
the
back.
however,
it
was
over
at
last,
and
they
sat
down
again
in
a
ring,
and
beg
the
mous
to
tell
them
someth
more.
you
promis
to
tell
me
your
history,
you
know,
said
alice,
and
whi
it
is
you
hate--c
and
d,
she
ad
in
a
whisper,
half
afraid
that
it
would
be
offend
again.
mine
is
a
long
and
a
sad
tale!
said
the
mouse,
turn
to
alice,
and
sighing.
it
is
a
long
tail,
certainly,
said
alice,
look
down
with
wonder
at
the
mous
tail;
but
whi
do
you
call
it
sad?
and
she
kept
on
puzzl
about
it
while
the
mous
was
speaking,
so
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
was
someth
like
this:--
furi
said
to
a
mouse,
that
he
met
in
the
house,
"let
us
both
go
to
law:
i
will
prosecut
you.--come,
i'll
take
no
denial;
we
must
have
a
trial:
for
realli
this
morn
i'v
noth
to
do."
said
the
mous
to
the
cur,
"such
a
trial,
dear
sir,
with
no
juri
or
judge,
would
be
wast
our
breath."
"i'll
be
judge,
i'll
be
jury,"
said
cun
old
fury:
"i'll
tri
the
whole
cause,
and
condemn
you
to
death."
you
are
not
attending!
said
the
mous
to
alic
severely.
what
are
you
think
of?
'i
beg
your
pardon,
said
alic
veri
humbly:
you
had
got
to
the
fifth
bend,
i
think?
'i
had
not!
cri
the
mouse,
sharpli
and
veri
angrily.
'a
knot!
said
alice,
alway
readi
to
make
herself
useful,
and
look
anxious
about
her.
oh,
do
let
me
help
to
undo
it!
'i
shall
do
noth
of
the
sort,
said
the
mouse,
get
up
and
walk
away.
you
insult
me
by
talk
such
nonsense!
'i
didn't
mean
it!
plead
poor
alice.
but
you'r
so
easili
offended,
you
know!
the
mous
onli
growl
in
reply.
pleas
come
back
and
finish
your
story!
alic
call
after
it;
and
the
other
all
join
in
chorus,
yes,
pleas
do!
but
the
mous
onli
shook
it
head
impatiently,
and
walk
a
littl
quicker.
what
a
piti
it
wouldn't
stay!
sigh
the
lory,
as
soon
as
it
was
quit
out
of
sight;
and
an
old
crab
took
the
opportun
of
say
to
her
daughter
ah,
my
dear!
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
lose
your
temper!
hold
your
tongue,
ma!
said
the
young
crab,
a
littl
snappishly.
you'r
enough
to
tri
the
patienc
of
an
oyster!
'i
wish
i
had
our
dinah
here,
i
know
i
do!
said
alic
aloud,
address
nobodi
in
particular.
she'd
soon
fetch
it
back!
and
who
is
dinah,
if
i
might
ventur
to
ask
the
question?
said
the
lory.
alic
repli
eagerly,
for
she
was
alway
readi
to
talk
about
her
pet:
dinah
our
cat.
and
she
such
a
capit
one
for
catch
mice
you
can't
think!
and
oh,
i
wish
you
could
see
her
after
the
birds!
why,
she'll
eat
a
littl
bird
as
soon
as
look
at
it!
this
speech
caus
a
remark
sensat
among
the
party.
some
of
the
bird
hurri
off
at
once:
one
old
magpi
began
wrap
itself
up
veri
carefully,
remarking,
'i
realli
must
be
get
home;
the
night-air
doesn't
suit
my
throat!
and
a
canari
call
out
in
a
trembl
voic
to
it
children,
come
away,
my
dears!
it
high
time
you
were
all
in
bed!
on
various
pretext
they
all
move
off,
and
alic
was
soon
left
alone.
'i
wish
i
hadn't
mention
dinah!
she
said
to
herself
in
a
melancholi
tone.
nobodi
seem
to
like
her,
down
here,
and
i'm
sure
she
the
best
cat
in
the
world!
oh,
my
dear
dinah!
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
you
ani
more!
and
here
poor
alic
began
to
cri
again,
for
she
felt
veri
lone
and
low-spirited.
in
a
littl
while,
however,
she
again
heard
a
littl
patter
of
footstep
in
the
distance,
and
she
look
up
eagerly,
half
hope
that
the
mous
had
chang
his
mind,
and
was
come
back
to
finish
his
story.
chapter
iv.
the
rabbit
send
in
a
littl
bill
it
was
the
white
rabbit,
trot
slowli
back
again,
and
look
anxious
about
as
it
went,
as
if
it
had
lost
something;
and
she
heard
it
mutter
to
itself
the
duchess!
the
duchess!
oh
my
dear
paws!
oh
my
fur
and
whiskers!
she'll
get
me
executed,
as
sure
as
ferret
are
ferrets!
where
can
i
have
drop
them,
i
wonder?
alic
guess
in
a
moment
that
it
was
look
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
gloves,
and
she
veri
good-natur
began
hunt
about
for
them,
but
they
were
nowher
to
be
seen--everyth
seem
to
have
chang
sinc
her
swim
in
the
pool,
and
the
great
hall,
with
the
glass
tabl
and
the
littl
door,
had
vanish
completely.
veri
soon
the
rabbit
notic
alice,
as
she
went
hunt
about,
and
call
out
to
her
in
an
angri
tone,
why,
mari
ann,
what
are
you
do
out
here?
run
home
this
moment,
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
glove
and
a
fan!
quick,
now!
and
alic
was
so
much
frighten
that
she
ran
off
at
onc
in
the
direct
it
point
to,
without
tri
to
explain
the
mistak
it
had
made.
he
took
me
for
his
housemaid,
she
said
to
herself
as
she
ran.
how
surpris
he'll
be
when
he
find
out
who
i
am!
but
i'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
gloves--that
is,
if
i
can
find
them.
as
she
said
this,
she
came
upon
a
neat
littl
house,
on
the
door
of
which
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
w.
rabbit
engrav
upon
it.
she
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurri
upstairs,
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
mari
ann,
and
be
turn
out
of
the
hous
befor
she
had
found
the
fan
and
gloves.
how
queer
it
seems,
alic
said
to
herself,
to
be
go
messag
for
a
rabbit!
i
suppos
dinah'l
be
send
me
on
messag
next!
and
she
began
fanci
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
happen:
"miss
alice!
come
here
directly,
and
get
readi
for
your
walk!"
"come
in
a
minute,
nurse!
but
i'v
got
to
see
that
the
mous
doesn't
get
out."
onli
i
don't
think,
alic
went
on,
that
they'd
let
dinah
stop
in
the
hous
if
it
began
order
peopl
about
like
that!
by
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidi
littl
room
with
a
tabl
in
the
window,
and
on
it
(as
she
had
hoped)
a
fan
and
two
or
three
pair
of
tini
white
kid
gloves:
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
gloves,
and
was
just
go
to
leav
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
littl
bottl
that
stood
near
the
looking-glass.
there
was
no
label
this
time
with
the
word
drink
me,
but
nevertheless
she
uncork
it
and
put
it
to
her
lips.
'i
know
someth
interest
is
sure
to
happen,
she
said
to
herself,
whenev
i
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
i'll
just
see
what
this
bottl
does.
i
do
hope
it'll
make
me
grow
larg
again,
for
realli
i'm
quit
tire
of
be
such
a
tini
littl
thing!
it
did
so
indeed,
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected:
befor
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle,
she
found
her
head
press
against
the
ceiling,
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
be
broken.
she
hastili
put
down
the
bottle,
say
to
herself
that
quit
enough--i
hope
i
shan't
grow
ani
more--a
it
is,
i
can't
get
out
at
the
door--i
do
wish
i
hadn't
drunk
quit
so
much!
alas!
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
she
went
on
growing,
and
growing,
and
veri
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor:
in
anoth
minut
there
was
not
even
room
for
this,
and
she
tri
the
effect
of
lie
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
door,
and
the
other
arm
curl
round
her
head.
still
she
went
on
growing,
and,
as
a
last
resource,
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
window,
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney,
and
said
to
herself
now
i
can
do
no
more,
whatev
happens.
what
will
becom
of
me?
luckili
for
alice,
the
littl
magic
bottl
had
now
had
it
full
effect,
and
she
grew
no
larger:
still
it
was
veri
uncomfortable,
and,
as
there
seem
to
be
no
sort
of
chanc
of
her
ever
get
out
of
the
room
again,
no
wonder
she
felt
unhappy.
it
was
much
pleasant
at
home,
thought
poor
alice,
when
one
wasn't
alway
grow
larger
and
smaller,
and
be
order
about
by
mice
and
rabbits.
i
almost
wish
i
hadn't
gone
down
that
rabbit-hole--and
yet--and
yet--it
rather
curious,
you
know,
this
sort
of
life!
i
do
wonder
what
can
have
happen
to
me!
when
i
use
to
read
fairy-tales,
i
fanci
that
kind
of
thing
never
happened,
and
now
here
i
am
in
the
middl
of
one!
there
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
me,
that
there
ought!
and
when
i
grow
up,
i'll
write
one--but
i'm
grown
up
now,
she
ad
in
a
sorrow
tone;
at
least
there
no
room
to
grow
up
ani
more
here.
but
then,
thought
alice,
shall
i
never
get
ani
older
than
i
am
now?
that'll
be
a
comfort,
one
way--nev
to
be
an
old
woman--but
then--alway
to
have
lesson
to
learn!
oh,
i
shouldn't
like
that!
oh,
you
foolish
alice!
she
answer
herself.
how
can
you
learn
lesson
in
here?
why,
there
hard
room
for
you,
and
no
room
at
all
for
ani
lesson-books!
and
so
she
went
on,
take
first
one
side
and
then
the
other,
and
make
quit
a
convers
of
it
altogether;
but
after
a
few
minut
she
heard
a
voic
outside,
and
stop
to
listen.
mari
ann!
mari
ann!
said
the
voice.
fetch
me
my
glove
this
moment!
then
came
a
littl
patter
of
feet
on
the
stairs.
alic
knew
it
was
the
rabbit
come
to
look
for
her,
and
she
trembl
till
she
shook
the
house,
quit
forget
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
time
as
larg
as
the
rabbit,
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it.
present
the
rabbit
came
up
to
the
door,
and
tri
to
open
it;
but,
as
the
door
open
inwards,
and
alic
elbow
was
press
hard
against
it,
that
attempt
prove
a
failure.
alic
heard
it
say
to
itself
then
i'll
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
window.
that
you
won't
thought
alice,
and,
after
wait
till
she
fanci
she
heard
the
rabbit
just
under
the
window,
she
sudden
spread
out
her
hand,
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air.
she
did
not
get
hold
of
anything,
but
she
heard
a
littl
shriek
and
a
fall,
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
conclud
that
it
was
just
possibl
it
had
fallen
into
a
cucumber-frame,
or
someth
of
the
sort.
next
came
an
angri
voice--th
rabbit's--'pat!
pat!
where
are
you?
and
then
a
voic
she
had
never
heard
before,
sure
then
i'm
here!
dig
for
apples,
yer
honour!
dig
for
apples,
indeed!
said
the
rabbit
angrily.
here!
come
and
help
me
out
of
this!
(sound
of
more
broken
glass.)
now
tell
me,
pat,
what
that
in
the
window?
sure,
it
an
arm,
yer
honour!
(he
pronounc
it
arrum.')
an
arm,
you
goose!
who
ever
saw
one
that
size?
why,
it
fill
the
whole
window!
sure,
it
does,
yer
honour:
but
it
an
arm
for
all
that.
well,
it
got
no
busi
there,
at
ani
rate:
go
and
take
it
away!
there
was
a
long
silenc
after
this,
and
alic
could
onli
hear
whisper
now
and
then;
such
as,
sure,
i
don't
like
it,
yer
honour,
at
all,
at
all!
do
as
i
tell
you,
you
coward!
and
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
again,
and
made
anoth
snatch
in
the
air.
this
time
there
were
two
littl
shrieks,
and
more
sound
of
broken
glass.
what
a
number
of
cucumber-fram
there
must
be!
thought
alice.
'i
wonder
what
they'll
do
next!
as
for
pull
me
out
of
the
window,
i
onli
wish
they
could!
i'm
sure
i
don't
want
to
stay
in
here
ani
longer!
she
wait
for
some
time
without
hear
anyth
more:
at
last
came
a
rumbl
of
littl
cartwheels,
and
the
sound
of
a
good
mani
voic
all
talk
together:
she
made
out
the
words:
where
the
other
ladder?--why,
i
hadn't
to
bring
but
one;
bill
got
the
other--bill!
fetch
it
here,
lad!--here,
put
em
up
at
this
corner--no,
tie
em
togeth
first--they
don't
reach
half
high
enough
yet--oh!
they'll
do
well
enough;
don't
be
particular--here,
bill!
catch
hold
of
this
rope--wil
the
roof
bear?--mind
that
loos
slate--oh,
it
come
down!
head
below!
(a
loud
crash)--'now,
who
did
that?--it
was
bill,
i
fancy--who
to
go
down
the
chimney?--nay,
i
shan't!
you
do
it!--that
i
won't,
then!--bil
to
go
down--here,
bill!
the
master
say
you'r
to
go
down
the
chimney!
oh!
so
bill
got
to
come
down
the
chimney,
has
he?
said
alic
to
herself.
shy,
they
seem
to
put
everyth
upon
bill!
i
wouldn't
be
in
bill
place
for
a
good
deal:
this
fireplac
is
narrow,
to
be
sure;
but
i
think
i
can
kick
a
little!
she
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
could,
and
wait
till
she
heard
a
littl
anim
(she
couldn't
guess
of
what
sort
it
was)
scratch
and
scrambl
about
in
the
chimney
close
abov
her:
then,
say
to
herself
this
is
bill,
she
gave
one
sharp
kick,
and
wait
to
see
what
would
happen
next.
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
there
goe
bill!
then
the
rabbit
voic
along--'catch
him,
you
by
the
hedge!
then
silence,
and
then
anoth
confus
of
voices--'hold
up
his
head--brandi
now--don't
choke
him--how
was
it,
old
fellow?
what
happen
to
you?
tell
us
all
about
it!
last
came
a
littl
feeble,
squeak
voice,
('that
bill,
thought
alice,)
well,
i
hard
know--no
more,
thank
ye;
i'm
better
now--but
i'm
a
deal
too
fluster
to
tell
you--al
i
know
is,
someth
come
at
me
like
a
jack-in-the-box,
and
up
i
goe
like
a
sky-rocket!
so
you
did,
old
fellow!
said
the
others.
we
must
burn
the
hous
down!
said
the
rabbit
voice;
and
alic
call
out
as
loud
as
she
could,
if
you
do.
i'll
set
dinah
at
you!
there
was
a
dead
silenc
instantly,
and
alic
thought
to
herself,
'i
wonder
what
they
will
do
next!
if
they
had
ani
sense,
they'd
take
the
roof
off.
after
a
minut
or
two,
they
began
move
about
again,
and
alic
heard
the
rabbit
say,
'a
barrow
will
do,
to
begin
with.
'a
barrow
of
what?
thought
alice;
but
she
had
not
long
to
doubt,
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
littl
pebbl
came
rattl
in
at
the
window,
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face.
i'll
put
a
stop
to
this,
she
said
to
herself,
and
shout
out,
you'd
better
not
do
that
again!
which
produc
anoth
dead
silence.
alic
notic
with
some
surpris
that
the
pebbl
were
all
turn
into
littl
cake
as
they
lay
on
the
floor,
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
head.
if
i
eat
one
of
these
cakes,
she
thought,
it
sure
to
make
some
chang
in
my
size;
and
as
it
can't
possibl
make
me
larger,
it
must
make
me
smaller,
i
suppose.
so
she
swallow
one
of
the
cakes,
and
was
delight
to
find
that
she
began
shrink
directly.
as
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
door,
she
ran
out
of
the
house,
and
found
quit
a
crowd
of
littl
anim
and
bird
wait
outside.
the
poor
littl
lizard,
bill,
was
in
the
middle,
be
held
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
give
it
someth
out
of
a
bottle.
they
all
made
a
rush
at
alic
the
moment
she
appeared;
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
could,
and
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
wood.
the
first
thing
i'v
got
to
do,
said
alic
to
herself,
as
she
wander
about
in
the
wood,
is
to
grow
to
my
right
size
again;
and
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
love
garden.
i
think
that
will
be
the
best
plan.
it
sound
an
excel
plan,
no
doubt,
and
veri
neat
and
simpli
arranged;
the
onli
difficulti
was,
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
it;
and
while
she
was
peer
about
anxious
among
the
trees,
a
littl
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
hurry.
an
enorm
puppi
was
look
down
at
her
with
larg
round
eyes,
and
feebli
stretch
out
one
paw,
tri
to
touch
her.
poor
littl
thing!
said
alice,
in
a
coax
tone,
and
she
tri
hard
to
whistl
to
it;
but
she
was
terribl
frighten
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
hungry,
in
which
case
it
would
be
veri
like
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
coaxing.
hard
know
what
she
did,
she
pick
up
a
littl
bit
of
stick,
and
held
it
out
to
the
puppy;
whereupon
the
puppi
jump
into
the
air
off
all
it
feet
at
once,
with
a
yelp
of
delight,
and
rush
at
the
stick,
and
made
believ
to
worri
it;
then
alic
dodg
behind
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
herself
from
be
run
over;
and
the
moment
she
appear
on
the
other
side,
the
puppi
made
anoth
rush
at
the
stick,
and
tumbl
head
over
heel
in
it
hurri
to
get
hold
of
it;
then
alice,
think
it
was
veri
like
have
a
game
of
play
with
a
cart-horse,
and
expect
everi
moment
to
be
trampl
under
it
feet,
ran
round
the
thistl
again;
then
the
puppi
began
a
seri
of
short
charg
at
the
stick,
run
a
veri
littl
way
forward
each
time
and
a
long
way
back,
and
bark
hoars
all
the
while,
till
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
off,
panting,
with
it
tongu
hang
out
of
it
mouth,
and
it
great
eye
half
shut.
this
seem
to
alic
a
good
opportun
for
make
her
escape;
so
she
set
off
at
once,
and
ran
till
she
was
quit
tire
and
out
of
breath,
and
till
the
puppi
bark
sound
quit
faint
in
the
distance.
and
yet
what
a
dear
littl
puppi
it
was!
said
alice,
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself,
and
fan
herself
with
one
of
the
leaves:
'i
should
have
like
teach
it
trick
veri
much,
if--if
i'd
onli
been
the
right
size
to
do
it!
oh
dear!
i'd
near
forgotten
that
i'v
got
to
grow
up
again!
let
me
see--how
is
it
to
be
managed?
i
suppos
i
ought
to
eat
or
drink
someth
or
other;
but
the
great
question
is,
what?
the
great
question
certain
was,
what?
alic
look
all
round
her
at
the
flower
and
the
blade
of
grass,
but
she
did
not
see
anyth
that
look
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
circumstances.
there
was
a
larg
mushroom
grow
near
her,
about
the
same
height
as
herself;
and
when
she
had
look
under
it,
and
on
both
side
of
it,
and
behind
it,
it
occur
to
her
that
she
might
as
well
look
and
see
what
was
on
the
top
of
it.
she
stretch
herself
up
on
tiptoe,
and
peep
over
the
edg
of
the
mushroom,
and
her
eye
immedi
met
those
of
a
larg
caterpillar,
that
was

on
the
top
with
it
arm
folded,
quiet
smoke
a
long
hookah,
and
take
not

of

or
of
anyth
else.

v.
advic
from
a
caterpillar
the
caterpillar
and
alic
look
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
silence:
at
last
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth,
and
address
her
in
a
languid,
sleepi
voice.
who
are
you?
said
the
caterpillar.
this
was
not
an
encourag
open
for
a
conversation.
alic
replied,
rather
shyly,
i--i
hard
know,
sir,
just
at
present--at
least
i
know
who
i
was
when
i
got
up
this
morning,
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
chang
sever
time
sinc
then.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
said
the
caterpillar
sternly.
explain
yourself!
'i
can't
explain
myself,
i'm
afraid,
sir
said
alice,
becaus
i'm
not
myself,
you
see.
'i
don't
see,
said
the
caterpillar.
i'm
afraid
i
can't
put
it
more
clearly,
alic
repli
veri
politely,
for
i
can't
understand
it
myself
to
begin
with;
and
be
so
mani
differ
size
in
a
day
is
veri
confusing.
it
isn't,
said
the
caterpillar.
well,
perhap
you
haven't
found
it
so
yet,
said
alice;
but
when
you
have
to
turn
into
a
chrysalis--you
will
some
day,
you
know--and
then
after
that
into
a
butterfly,
i
should
think
you'll
feel
it
a
littl
queer,
won't
you?
not
a
bit,
said
the
caterpillar.
well,
perhap
your
feel
may
be
different,
said
alice;
all
i
know
is,
it
would
feel
veri
queer
to
me.
you!
said
the
caterpillar
contemptuously.
who
are
you?
which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
begin
of
the
conversation.
alic
felt
a
littl
irrit
at
the
caterpillar
make
such
veri
short
remarks,
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
said,
veri
gravely,
'i
think,
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are,
first.
why?
said
the
caterpillar.
here
was
anoth
puzzl
question;
and
as
alic
could
not
think
of
ani
good
reason,
and
as
the
caterpillar
seem
to
be
in
a
veri
unpleas
state
of
mind,
she
turn
away.
come
back!
the
caterpillar
call
after
her.
i'v
someth
import
to
say!
this
sound
promising,
certainly:
alic
turn
and
came
back
again.
keep
your
temper,
said
the
caterpillar.
is
that
all?
said
alice,
swallow
down
her
anger
as
well
as
she
could.
no,
said
the
caterpillar.
alic
thought
she
might
as
well
wait,
as
she
had
noth
els
to
do,
and
perhap
after
all
it
might
tell
her
someth
worth
hearing.
for
some
minut
it
puf
away
without
speaking,
but
at
last
it
unfold
it
arms,
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth
again,
and
said,
so
you
think
you'r
changed,
do
you?
i'm
afraid
i
am,
sir,
said
alice;
'i
can't
rememb
thing
as
i
used--and
i
don't
keep
the
same
size
for
ten
minut
together!
can't
rememb
what
things?
said
the
caterpillar.
well,
i'v
tri
to
say
"how
doth
the
littl
busi
bee,"
but
it
all
came
different!
alic
repli
in
a
veri
melancholi
voice.
repeat,
"you
are
old,
father
william,"
said
the
caterpillar.
alic
fold
her
hands,
and
began:--
you
are
old,
father
william,
the
young
man
said,
and
your
hair
has
becom
veri
white;
and
yet
you
incess
stand
on
your
head--
do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
right?
in
my
youth,
father
william
repli
to
his
son,
'i
fear
it
might
injur
the
brain;
but,
now
that
i'm
perfect
sure
i
have
none,
why,
i
do
it
again
and
again.
you
are
old,
said
the
youth,
as
i
mention
before,
and
have
grown
most
uncommon
fat;
yet
you
turn
a
back-somersault
in
at
the
door--
pray,
what
is
the
reason
of
that?
in
my
youth,
said
the
sage,
as
he
shook
his
grey
locks,
'i
kept
all
my
limb
veri
suppl
by
the
use
of
this
ointment--on
shill
the
box--
allow
me
to

you
a

you
are
old,
said
the
youth,
and
your
jaw
are
too
weak
for
anyth
tougher
than
suet;
yet
you
finish
the
goose,
with
the
bone
and
the
beak--
pray
how
did
you
manag
to
do
it?
in
my
youth,
said
his
father,
'i
took
to
the
law,
and
argu
each
case
with
my
wife;
and
the
muscular
strength,
which
it
gave
to
my
jaw,
has
last
the
rest
of
my
life.
you

said
the
youth,

suppos
that

was
as

as

yet
you
balanc
an

on
the

of
your

what
made
you
so
aw
clever?
'i
have
answer
three
questions,
and
that
is
enough,
said
his
father;
don't
give
yourself
airs!
do
you
think
i
can
listen
all
day
to
such
stuff?
be
off,
or
i'll
kick
you
down
stairs!
that
is
not
said
right,
said
the
caterpillar.
not
quit
right,
i'm
afraid,
said
alice,
timidly;
some
of
the
word
have
got
altered.
it
is
wrong
from
begin
to
end,
said
the
caterpillar
decidedly,
and
there
was
silenc
for
some
minutes.
the
caterpillar
was
the
first
to
speak.
what
size
do
you
want
to
be?
it
asked.
oh,
i'm
not
particular
as
to
size,
alic
hastili
replied;
on
one
doesn't
like
chang
so
often,
you
know.
'i
don't
know,
said
the
caterpillar.
alic
said
nothing:
she
had
never
been
so
much
contradict
in
her
life
before,
and
she
felt
that
she
was
lose
her
temper.
are
you
content
now?
said
the
caterpillar.
well,
i
should
like
to
be
a
littl
larger,
sir,
if
you
wouldn't
mind,
said
alice:
three
inch
is
such
a
wretch
height
to
be.
it
is
a
veri
good
height
indeed!
said
the
caterpillar
angrily,
rear
itself
upright
as
it
spoke
(it
was
exact
three
inch
high).
but
i'm
not
use
to
it!
plead
poor
alic
in
a
piteous
tone.
and
she
thought
of
herself,
'i
wish
the
creatur
wouldn't
be
so
easili
offended!
you'll
get
use
to
it
in
time,
said
the
caterpillar;
and
it
put
the
hookah
into
it
mouth
and
began
smoke
again.
this
time
alic
wait
patient
until
it
chose
to
speak
again.
in
a
minut
or
two
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth
and
yawn
onc
or
twice,
and
shook
itself.
then
it
got
down
off
the
mushroom,
and
crawl
away
in
the
grass,
mere
remark
as
it
went,
one
side
will
make
you
grow
taller,
and
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
shorter.
one
side
of
what?
the
other
side
of
what?
thought
alic
to
herself.
of
the
mushroom,
said
the
caterpillar,
just
as
if
she
had
ask
it
aloud;
and
in
anoth
moment
it
was
out
of
sight.
alic
remain
look
thought
at
the
mushroom
for
a
minute,
tri
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
side
of
it;
and
as
it
was
perfect
round,
she
found
this
a
veri
difficult
question.
however,
at
last
she
stretch
her
arm
round
it
as
far
as
they
would
go,
and
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
edg
with
each
hand.
and
now
which
is
which?
she
said
to
herself,
and
nibbl
a
littl
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
tri
the
effect:
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin:
it
had
struck
her
foot!
she
was
a
good
deal
frighten
by
this
veri
sudden
change,
but
she
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost,
as
she
was
shrink
rapidly;
so
she
set
to
work
at
onc
to
eat
some
of
the
other
bit.
her
chin
was
press
so
close
against
her
foot,
that
there
was
hard
room
to
open
her
mouth;
but
she
did
it
at
last,
and
manag
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
lefthand

come,
my
head
free
at
last!
said
alic
in
a
tone
of
delight,
which
chang
into
alarm
in
anoth
moment,
when
she
found
that
her
shoulder
were
nowher
to
be
found:
all
she
could
see,
when
she
look
down,
was
an
immens
length
of
neck,
which
seem
to
rise
like
a
stalk
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leav
that
lay
far
below
her.
what
can
all
that
green
stuff
be?
said
alice.
and
where
have
my
shoulder
got
to?
and
oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
i
can't
see
you?
she
was
move
them
about
as
she
spoke,
but
no
result
seem
to
follow,
except
a
littl
shake
among
the
distant
green
leaves.
as
there
seem
to
be
no
chanc
of
get
her
hand
up
to
her
head,
she
tri
to
get
her
head
down
to
them,
and
was
delight
to
find
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easili
in
ani
direction,
like
a
serpent.
she
had
just
succeed
in
curv
it
down
into
a
grace
zigzag,
and
was
go
to
dive
in
among
the
leaves,
which
she
found
to
be
noth
but
the
top
of
the
tree
under
which
she
had
been
wandering,
when
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
draw
back
in
a
hurry:
a
larg
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face,
and
was
beat
her
violent
with
it
wings.
serpent!
scream
the
pigeon.
i'm
not
a
serpent!
said
alic
indignantly.
let
me
alone!
serpent,
i
say
again!
repeat
the
pigeon,
but
in
a
more
subdu
tone,
and
ad
with
a
kind
of
sob,
i'v
tri
everi
way,
and
noth
seem
to
suit
them!
'i
haven't
the
least
idea
what
you'r
talk
about,
said
alice.
i'v
tri
the
root
of
trees,
and
i'v
tri
banks,
and
i'v
tri
hedges,
the
pigeon
went
on,
without
attend
to
her;
but
those
serpents!
there
no
pleas
them!
alic
was
more
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
thought
there
was
no
use
in
say
anyth
more
till
the
pigeon
had
finished.
as
if
it
wasn't
troubl
enough
hatch
the
eggs,
said
the
pigeon;
but
i
must
be
on
the
look-out
for
serpent
night
and
day!
why,
i
haven't
had
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
weeks!
i'm
veri
sorri
you'v
been
annoyed,
said
alice,
who
was
begin
to
see
it
meaning.
and
just
as
i'd
taken
the
highest
tree
in
the
wood,
continu
the
pigeon,
rais
it
voic
to
a
shriek,
and
just
as
i
was
think
i
should
be
free
of
them
at
last,
they
must
need
come
wriggl
down
from
the
sky!
ugh,
serpent!
but
i'm
not
a
serpent,
i
tell
you!
said
alice.
i'm
a--i'm
a--
well!
what
are
you?
said
the
pigeon.
'i
can
see
you'r
tri
to
invent
something!
i--i'm
a
littl
girl,
said
alice,
rather
doubtfully,
as
she
rememb
the
number
of
chang
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
'a
like
stori
indeed!
said
the
pigeon
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
contempt.
i'v
seen
a
good
mani
littl
girl
in
my
time,
but
never
one
with
such
a
neck
as
that!
no,
no!
you'r
a
serpent;
and
there
no
use
deni
it.
i
suppos
you'll
be
tell
me
next
that
you
never
tast
an
egg!
'i
have
tast
eggs,
certainly,
said
alice,
who
was
a
veri
truth
child;
but
littl
girl
eat
egg
quit
as
much
as
serpent
do,
you
know.
'i
don't
believ
it,
said
the
pigeon;
but
if
they
do,
whi
then
they'r
a
kind
of
serpent,
that
all
i
can
say.
this
was
such
a
new
idea
to
alice,
that
she
was
quit
silent
for
a
minut
or
two,
which
gave
the
pigeon
the
opportun
of
adding,
you'r
look
for
eggs,
i
know
that
well
enough;
and
what
doe
it
matter
to
me
whether
you'r
a
littl
girl
or
a
serpent?
it
matter
a
good
deal
to
me,
said
alic
hastily;
but
i'm
not
look
for
eggs,
as
it
happens;
and
if
i
was,
i
shouldn't
want
yours:
i
don't
like
them
raw.
well,
be
off,
then!
said
the
pigeon
in
a
sulki
tone,
as
it
settl
down
again
into
it
nest.
alic
crouch
down
among
the
tree
as
well
as
she
could,
for
her
neck
kept
get
entangl
among
the
branches,
and
everi
now
and
then
she
had
to
stop
and
untwist
it.
after
a
while
she
rememb
that
she
still
held
the
piec
of
mushroom
in
her
hands,
and
she
set
to
work
veri
carefully,
nibbl
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other,
and
grow
sometim
taller
and
sometim
shorter,
until
she
had
succeed
in
bring
herself
down
to
her
usual
height.
it
was
so
long
sinc
she
had
been
anyth
near
the
right
size,
that
it
felt
quit
strang
at
first;
but
she
got
use
to
it
in
a
few
minutes,
and
began
talk
to
herself,
as
usual.
come,
there
half
my
plan
done
now!
how
puzzl
all
these
chang
are!
i'm
never
sure
what
i'm
go
to
be,
from
one
minut
to
another!
however,
i'v
got
back
to
my
right
size:
the
next
thing
is,
to
get
into
that
beauti
garden--how
is
that
to
be
done,
i
wonder?
as
she
said
this,
she
came
sudden
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
littl
hous
in
it
about
four
feet
high.
whoever
live
there,
thought
alice,
it'll
never
do
to
come
upon
them
this
size:
why,
i
should
frighten
them
out
of
their
wits!
so
she
began
nibbl
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
did
not
ventur
to
go
near
the
hous
till
she
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inch
high.

pig
and
pepper
for
a
minut
or
two
she
stood
look
at
the
house,
and
wonder
what
to
do
next,
when
sudden
a
footman
in
liveri
came
run
out
of
the
wood--(sh
consid
him
to
be
a
footman
becaus
he
was
in
livery:
otherwise,
judg
by
his
face
only,
she
would
have
call
him
a
fish)--and
rap
loud
at
the
door
with
his
knuckles.
it
was
open
by
anoth
footman
in
livery,
with
a
round
face,
and
larg
eye
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
alic
noticed,
had
powder
hair
that
curl
all
over
their
heads.
she
felt
veri
curious
to
know
what
it
was
all
about,
and
crept
a
littl
way
out
of
the
wood
to
listen.
the
fish-footman
began
by
produc
from
under
his
arm
a
great
letter,
near
as
larg
as
himself,
and
this
he
hand
over
to
the
other,
saying,
in
a
solemn
tone,
for
the
duchess.
an
invit
from
the
queen
to
play
croquet.
the
frog-footman
repeated,
in
the
same
solemn
tone,
onli
chang
the
order
of
the
word
a
little,
from
the
queen.
an
invit
for
the
duchess
to
play
croquet.
then
they
both
bow
low,
and
their
curl
got
entangl
together.
alic
laugh
so
much
at
this,
that
she
had
to
run
back
into
the
wood
for
fear
of
their
hear
her;
and
when
she
next
peep
out
the
fish-footman
was
gone,
and
the
other
was
sit
on
the
ground
near
the
door,
stare
stupid
up
into
the
sky.
alic
went
timid
up
to
the
door,
and
knocked.
there
no
sort
of
use
in
knocking,
said
the
footman,
and
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
becaus
i'm
on
the
same
side
of
the
door
as
you
are;
secondly,
becaus
they'r
make
such
a
nois
inside,
no
one
could
possibl
hear
you.
and
certain
there
was
a
most
extraordinari
nois
go
on
within--a
constant
howl
and
sneezing,
and
everi
now
and
then
a
great
crash,
as
if
a
dish
or
kettl
had
been
broken
to
pieces.
please,
then,
said
alice,
how
am
i
to
get
in?
there
might
be
some
sens
in
your
knocking,
the
footman
went
on
without
attend
to
her,
if
we
had
the
door
between
us.
for
instance,
if
you
were
inside,
you
might
knock,
and
i
could
let
you
out,
you
know.
he
was
look
up
into
the
sky
all
the
time
he
was
speaking,
and
this
alic
thought
decid
uncivil.
but
perhap
he
can't
help
it,
she
said
to
herself;
his
eye
are
so
veri
near
at
the
top
of
his
head.
but
at
ani
rate
he
might
answer
questions.--how
am
i
to
get
in?
she
repeated,
aloud.
'i
shall
sit
here,
the
footman
remarked,
till
tomorrow--
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
hous
opened,
and
a
larg
plate
came
skim
out,
straight
at
the
footman
head:
it
just
graze
his
nose,
and
broke
to
piec
against
one
of
the
tree
behind
him.
--or
next
day,
maybe,
the
footman
continu
in
the
same
tone,
exact
as
if
noth
had
happened.
how
am
i
to
get
in?
ask
alic
again,
in
a
louder
tone.
are
you
to
get
in
at
all?
said
the
footman.
that
the
first
question,
you
know.
it
was,
no
doubt:
onli
alic
did
not
like
to
be
told
so.
it
realli
dreadful,
she
mutter
to
herself,
the
way
all
the
creatur
argue.
it
enough
to
drive
one
crazy!
the
footman
seem
to
think
this
a
good
opportun
for
repeat
his
remark,
with
variations.
'i
shall
sit
here,
he
said,
on
and
off,
for
day
and
days.
but
what
am
i
to
do?
said
alice.
anyth
you
like,
said
the
footman,
and
began
whistling.
oh,
there
no
use
in
talk
to
him,
said
alic
desperately:
he
perfect
idiotic!
and
she
open
the
door
and
went
in.
the
door
led
right
into
a
larg
kitchen,
which
was
full
of
smoke
from
one
end
to
the
other:
the
duchess
was
sit
on
a
three-leg
stool
in
the
middle,
nurs
a
baby;
the
cook
was
lean
over
the
fire,
stir
a
larg
cauldron
which
seem
to
be
full
of
soup.
there
certain
too
much
pepper
in
that
soup!
alic
said
to
herself,
as
well
as
she
could
for
sneezing.
there
was
certain
too
much
of
it
in
the
air.
even
the
duchess
sneez
occasionally;
and
as
for
the
baby,
it
was
sneez
and
howl
altern
without
a
moment
pause.
the
onli
thing
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
sneeze,
were
the
cook,
and
a
larg
cat
which
was
sit
on
the
hearth
and
grin
from
ear
to
ear.
pleas
would
you
tell
me,
said
alice,
a
littl
timidly,
for
she
was
not
quit
sure
whether
it
was
good
manner
for
her
to
speak
first,
whi
your
cat
grin
like
that?
it
a
cheshir
cat,
said
the
duchess,
and
that
why.
pig!
she
said
the
last
word
with
such
sudden
violenc
that
alic
quit
jumped;
but
she
saw
in
anoth
moment
that
it
was
address
to
the
baby,
and
not
to
her,
so
she
took
courage,
and
went
on
again:--
'i
didn't
know
that
cheshir
cat
alway
grinned;
in
fact,
i
didn't
know
that
cat
could
grin.
they
all
can,
said
the
duchess;
and
most
of
em
do.
'i
don't
know
of
ani
that
do,
alic
said
veri
politely,
feel
quit
pleas
to
have
got
into
a
conversation.
you
don't
know
much,
said
the
duchess;
and
that
a
fact.
alic
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
of
this
remark,
and
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
introduc
some
other
subject
of
conversation.
while
she
was
tri
to
fix
on
one,
the
cook
took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
the
fire,
and
at
onc
set
to
work
throw
everyth
within
her
reach
at
the
duchess
and
the
baby--th
fire-iron
came
first;
then
follow
a
shower
of
saucepans,
plates,
and
dishes.
the
duchess
took
no
notic
of
them
even
when
they
hit
her;
and
the
babi
was
howl
so
much
already,
that
it
was
quit
imposs
to
say
whether
the
blow
hurt
it
or
not.
oh,
pleas
mind
what
you'r
doing!
cri
alice,
jump
up
and
down
in
an
agoni
of
terror.
oh,
there
goe
his
precious
nose';
as
an
unusu
larg
saucepan
flew
close
by
it,
and
veri
near
carri
it
off.
if
everybodi
mind
their
own
business,
the
duchess
said
in
a
hoars
growl,
the
world
would
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
does.
which
would
not
be
an
advantage,
said
alice,
who
felt
veri
glad
to
get
an
opportun
of
show
off
a
littl
of
her
knowledge.
just
think
of
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
night!
you
see
the
earth
take
twenty-four
hour
to
turn
round
on
it
axis--
talk
of
axes,
said
the
duchess,
chop
off
her
head!
alic
glanc
rather
anxious
at
the
cook,
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
the
hint;
but
the
cook
was
busili
stir
the
soup,
and
seem
not
to
be
listening,
so
she
went
on
again:
twenty-four
hours,
i
think;
or
is
it
twelve?
i--
oh,
don't
bother
me,
said
the
duchess;
'i
never
could
abid
figures!
and
with
that
she
began
nurs
her
child
again,
sing
a
sort
of
lullabi
to
it
as
she
did
so,
and
give
it
a
violent
shake
at
the
end
of
everi
line:
speak
rough
to
your
littl
boy,
and
beat
him
when
he
sneezes:
he
onli
doe
it
to
annoy,
becaus
he
know
it
teases.
chorus.
(in
which
the
cook
and
the
babi
joined):--
wow!
wow!
wow!
while
the
duchess
sang
the
second
vers
of
the
song,
she
kept
toss
the
babi
violent
up
and
down,
and
the
poor
littl
thing
howl
so,
that
alic
could
hard
hear
the
words:--
'i
speak
sever
to
my
boy,
i
beat
him
when
he
sneezes;
for
he
can
thorough
enjoy
the
pepper
when
he
pleases!
chorus.
wow!
wow!
wow!
here!
you
may
nurs
it
a
bit,
if
you
like!
the
duchess
said
to
alice,
fling
the
babi
at
her
as
she
spoke.
'i
must
go
and
get
readi
to
play
croquet
with
the
queen,
and
she
hurri
out
of
the
room.
the
cook
threw
a
frying-pan
after
her
as
she
went
out,
but
it
just
miss
her.
alic
caught
the
babi
with
some
difficulty,
as
it
was
a
queer-shap
littl
creature,
and
held
out
it
arm
and
leg
in
all
directions,
just
like
a
star-fish,
thought
alice.
the
poor
littl
thing
was
snort
like
a
steam-engin
when
she
caught
it,
and
kept
doubl
itself
up
and
straighten
itself
out
again,
so
that
altogether,
for
the
first
minut
or
two,
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
hold
it.
as
soon
as
she
had
made
out
the
proper
way
of
nurs
it,
(which
was
to
twist
it
up
into
a
sort
of
knot,
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
it
right
ear
and
left
foot,
so
as
to
prevent
it
undo
itself,)
she
carri
it
out
into
the
open
air.
if
i
don't
take
this
child
away
with
me,
thought
alice,
they'r
sure
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn't
it
be
murder
to
leav
it
behind?
she
said
the
last
word
out
loud,
and
the
littl
thing
grunt
in
repli
(it
had
left
off
sneez
by
this
time).
don't
grunt,
said
alice;
that
not
at
all
a
proper
way
of
express
yourself.
the
babi
grunt
again,
and
alic
look
veri
anxious
into
it
face
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
it.
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
a
veri
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
snout
than
a
real
nose;
also
it
eye
were
get
extrem
small
for
a
baby:
altogeth
alic
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
thing
at
all.
but
perhap
it
was
onli
sobbing,
she
thought,
and
look
into
it
eye
again,
to
see
if
there
were
ani
tears.
no,
there
were
no
tears.
if
you'r
go
to
turn
into
a
pig,
my
dear,
said
alice,
seriously,
i'll
have
noth
more
to
do
with
you.
mind
now!
the
poor
littl
thing
sob
again
(or
grunted,
it
was
imposs
to
say
which),
and
they
went
on
for
some
while
in
silence.
alic
was
just
begin
to
think
to
herself,
now,
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
creatur
when
i
get
it
home?
when
it
grunt
again,
so
violently,
that
she
look
down
into
it
face
in
some
alarm.
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistak
about
it:
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
pig,
and
she
felt
that
it
would
be
quit
absurd
for
her
to
carri
it
further.
so
she
set
the
littl
creatur
down,
and
felt
quit
reliev
to
see
it
trot
away
quiet
into
the
wood.
if
it
had
grown
up,
she
said
to
herself,
it
would
have
made
a
dread
ugli
child:
but
it
make
rather
a
handsom
pig,
i
think.
and
she
began
think
over
other
children
she
knew,
who
might
do
veri
well
as
pigs,
and
was
just
say
to
herself,
if
one
onli
knew
the
right
way
to
chang
them--
when
she
was
a
littl
startl
by
see
the
cheshir
cat
sit
on
a
bough
of
a
tree
a
few
yard
off.
the
cat
onli
grin
when
it
saw
alice.
it
look
good-natured,
she
thought:
still
it
had
veri
long
claw
and
a
great
mani
teeth,
so
she
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
treat
with
respect.
cheshir
puss,
she
began,
rather
timidly,
as
she
did
not
at
all
know
whether
it
would
like
the
name:
however,
it
onli
grin
a
littl
wider.
come,
it
pleas
so
far,
thought
alice,
and
she
went
on.
would
you
tell
me,
please,
which
way
i
ought
to
go
from
here?
that
depend
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to,
said
the
cat.
'i
don't
much
care
where--
said
alice.
then
it
doesn't
matter
which
way
you
go,
said
the
cat.
--so
long
as
i
get
somewhere,
alic
ad
as
an
explanation.
oh,
you'r
sure
to
do
that,
said
the
cat,
if
you
onli
walk
long
enough.
alic
felt
that
this
could
not
be
denied,
so
she
tri
anoth
question.
what
sort
of
peopl
live
about
here?
in
that
direction,
the
cat
said,
wave
it
right
paw
round,
live
a
hatter:
and
in
that
direction,
wave
the
other
paw,
live
a
march
hare.
visit
either
you
like:
they'r
both
mad.
but
i
don't
want
to
go
among
mad
people,
alic
remarked.
oh,
you
can't
help
that,
said
the
cat:
we'r
all
mad
here.
i'm
mad.
you'r
mad.
how
do
you
know
i'm
mad?
said
alice.
you
must
be,
said
the
cat,
or
you
wouldn't
have
come
here.
alic
didn't
think
that
prove
it
at
all;
however,
she
went
on
and
how
do
you
know
that
you'r
mad?
to
begin
with,
said
the
cat,
'a
dog
not
mad.
you
grant
that?
'i
suppos
so,
said
alice.
well,
then,
the
cat
went
on,
you
see,
a
dog
growl
when
it
angry,
and
wag
it
tail
when
it
pleased.
now
i
growl
when
i'm
pleased,
and
wag
my
tail
when
i'm
angry.
therefor
i'm
mad.
'i
call
it
purring,
not
growling,
said
alice.
call
it
what
you
like,
said
the
cat.
do
you
play
croquet
with
the
queen
to-day?
'i
should
like
it
veri
much,
said
alice,
but
i
haven't
been
invit
yet.
you'll
see
me
there,
said
the
cat,
and
vanished.
alic
was
not
much
surpris
at
this,
she
was
get
so
use
to
queer
thing
happening.
while
she
was
look
at
the
place
where
it
had
been,
it
sudden
appear
again.
by-the-bye,
what
becam
of
the
baby?
said
the
cat.
i'd
near
forgotten
to
ask.
it
turn
into
a
pig,
alic
quiet
said,
just
as
if
it
had
come
back
in
a
natur
way.
'i
thought
it
would,
said
the
cat,
and
vanish
again.
alic
wait
a
little,
half
expect
to
see
it
again,
but
it
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
minut
or
two
she
walk
on
in
the
direct
in
which
the
march
hare
was
said
to
live.
i'v
seen
hatter
before,
she
said
to
herself;
the
march
hare
will
be
much
the
most
interesting,
and
perhap
as
this
is
may
it
won't
be
rave
mad--at
least
not
so
mad
as
it
was
in
march.
as
she
said
this,
she
look
up,
and
there
was
the
cat
again,
sit
on
a
branch
of
a
tree.
did
you
say
pig,
or
fig?
said
the
cat.
'i
said
pig,
repli
alice;
and
i
wish
you
wouldn't
keep
appear
and
vanish
so
suddenly:
you
make
one
quit
giddy.
all
right,
said
the
cat;
and
this
time
it
vanish
quit
slowly,
begin
with
the
end
of
the
tail,
and
end
with
the
grin,
which
remain
some
time
after
the
rest
of
it
had
gone.
well!
i'v
often
seen
a
cat
without
a
grin,
thought
alice;
but
a
grin
without
a
cat!
it
the
most
curious
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life!
she
had
not
gone
much
farther
befor
she
came
in
sight
of
the
hous
of
the
march
hare:
she
thought
it
must
be
the
right
house,
becaus
the
chimney
were
shape
like
ear
and
the
roof
was
thatch
with
fur.
it
was
so
larg
a
house,
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
nearer
till
she
had
nibbl
some
more
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
mushroom,
and
rais
herself
to
about
two
feet
high:
even
then
she
walk
up
toward
it
rather
timidly,
say
to
herself
suppos
it
should
be
rave
mad
after
all!
i
almost
wish
i'd
gone
to
see
the
hatter
instead!
chapter
vii.
a
mad
tea-parti
there
was
a
tabl
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
the
house,
and
the
march
hare
and
the
hatter
were
have
tea
at
it:
a
dormous
was
sit
between
them,
fast
asleep,
and
the
other
two
were
use
it
as
a
cushion,
rest
their
elbow
on
it,
and
talk
over
it
head.
veri
uncomfort
for
the
dormouse,
thought
alice;
only,
as
it
asleep,
i
suppos
it
doesn't
mind.
the
tabl
was
a
larg
one,
but
the
three
were
all
crowd
togeth
at
one
corner
of
it:
no
room!
no
room!
they
cri
out
when
they
saw
alic
coming.
there
plenti
of
room!
said
alic
indignantly,
and
she
sat
down
in
a
larg
arm-chair
at
one
end
of
the
table.
have
some
wine,
the
march
hare
said
in
an
encourag
tone.
alic
look
all
round
the
table,
but
there
was
noth
on
it
but
tea.
'i
don't
see
ani
wine,
she
remarked.
there
isn't
any,
said
the
march
hare.
then
it
wasn't
veri
civil
of
you
to
offer
it,
said
alic
angrily.
it
wasn't
veri
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
be
invited,
said
the
march
hare.
'i
didn't
know
it
was
your
table,
said
alice;
it
laid
for
a
great
mani
more
than
three.
your
hair
want
cutting,
said
the
hatter.
he
had
been
look
at
alic
for
some
time
with
great
curiosity,
and
this
was
his
first
speech.
you
should
learn
not
to
make
person
remarks,
alic
said
with
some
severity;
it
veri
rude.
the
hatter
open
his
eye
veri
wide
on
hear
this;
but
all
he
said
was,
whi
is
a
raven
like
a
writing-desk?
come,
we
shall
have
some
fun
now!
thought
alice.
i'm
glad
they'v
begun
ask
riddles.--i
believ
i
can
guess
that,
she
ad
aloud.
do
you
mean
that
you
think
you
can
find
out
the
answer
to
it?
said
the
march
hare.
exact
so,
said
alice.
then
you
should
say
what
you
mean,
the
march
hare
went
on.
'i
do,
alic
hastili
replied;
at
least--at
least
i
mean
what
i
say--that
the
same
thing,
you
know.
not
the
same
thing
a
bit!
said
the
hatter.
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
"i
see
what
i
eat"
is
the
same
thing
as
"i
eat
what
i
see"!
you
might
just
as
well
say,
ad
the
march
hare,
that
"i
like
what
i
get"
is
the
same
thing
as
"i
get
what
i
like"!
you
might
just
as
well
say,
ad
the
dormouse,
who
seem
to
be
talk
in
his
sleep,
that
"i
breath
when
i
sleep"
is
the
same
thing
as
"i
sleep
when
i
breathe"!
it
is
the
same
thing
with
you,
said
the
hatter,
and
here
the
convers
dropped,
and
the
parti
sat
silent
for
a
minute,
while
alic
thought
over
all
she
could
rememb
about
raven
and
writing-desks,
which
wasn't
much.
the
hatter
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence.
what
day
of
the
month
is
it?
he
said,
turn
to
alice:
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket,
and
was
look
at
it
uneasily,
shake
it
everi
now
and
then,
and
hold
it
to
his
ear.
alic
consid
a
little,
and
then
said
the
fourth.
two
day
wrong!
sigh
the
hatter.
'i
told
you
butter
wouldn't
suit
the
works!
he
ad
look
angrili
at
the
march
hare.
it
was
the
best
butter,
the
march
hare
meek
replied.
yes,
but
some
crumb
must
have
got
in
as
well,
the
hatter
grumbled:
you
shouldn't
have
put
it
in
with
the
bread-knife.
the
march
hare
took
the
watch
and
look
at
it
gloomily:
then
he
dip
it
into
his
cup
of
tea,
and
look
at
it
again:
but
he
could
think
of
noth
better
to
say
than
his
first
remark,
it
was
the
best
butter,
you
know.
alic
had
been
look
over
his
shoulder
with
some
curiosity.
what
a
funni
watch!
she
remarked.
it
tell
the
day
of
the
month,
and
doesn't
tell
what
o'clock
it
is!
whi
should
it?
mutter
the
hatter.
doe
your
watch
tell
you
what
year
it
is?
of
cours
not,
alic
repli
veri
readily:
but
that
becaus
it
stay
the
same
year
for
such
a
long
time
together.
which
is
just
the
case
with
mine,
said
the
hatter.
alic
felt
dread
puzzled.
the
hatter
remark
seem
to
have
no
sort
of
mean
in
it,
and
yet
it
was
certain
english.
'i
don't
quit
understand
you,
she
said,
as
polit
as
she
could.
the
dormous
is
asleep
again,
said
the
hatter,
and
he
pour
a
littl
hot
tea
upon
it
nose.
the
dormous
shook
it
head
impatiently,
and
said,
without
open
it
eyes,
of
course,
of
course;
just
what
i
was
go
to
remark
myself.
have
you
guess
the
riddl
yet?
the
hatter
said,
turn
to
alic
again.
no,
i
give
it
up,
alic
replied:
what
the
answer?
'i
haven't
the
slightest
idea,
said
the
hatter.
nor
i,
said
the
march
hare.
alic
sigh
wearily.
'i
think
you
might
do
someth
better
with
the
time,
she
said,
than
wast
it
in
ask
riddl
that
have
no
answers.
if
you
knew
time
as
well
as
i
do,
said
the
hatter,
you
wouldn't
talk
about
wast
it.
it
him.
'i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
said
alice.
of
cours
you
don't!
the
hatter
said,
toss
his
head
contemptuously.
'i
dare
say
you
never
even
spoke
to
time!
perhap
not,
alic
cautious
replied:
but
i
know
i
have
to
beat
time
when
i
learn
music.
ah!
that
account
for
it,
said
the
hatter.
he
won't
stand
beating.
now,
if
you
onli
kept
on
good
term
with
him,
he'd
do
almost
anyth
you
like
with
the
clock.
for
instance,
suppos
it
were
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
onli
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
time,
and
round
goe
the
clock
in
a
twinkling!
half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!
('i
onli
wish
it
was,
the
march
hare
said
to
itself
in
a
whisper.)
that
would
be
grand,
certainly,
said
alic
thoughtfully:
but
then--i
shouldn't
be
hungri
for
it,
you
know.
not
at
first,
perhaps,
said
the
hatter:
but
you
could
keep
it
to
half-past
one
as
long
as
you
liked.
is
that
the
way
you
manage?
alic
asked.
the
hatter
shook
his
head
mournfully.
not
i!
he
replied.
we
quarrel
last
march--just
befor
he
went
mad,
you
know--
(point
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
march
hare,)
--it
was
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
queen
of
hearts,
and
i
had
to
sing
"twinkle,
twinkle,
littl
bat!
how
i
wonder
what
you'r
at!"
you
know
the
song,
perhaps?
i'v
heard
someth
like
it,
said
alice.
it
goe
on,
you
know,
the
hatter
continued,
in
this
way:--
"up
abov
the
world
you
fly,
like
a
tea-tray
in
the
sky.
twinkle,
twinkle--"
here
the
dormous
shook
itself,
and
began
sing
in
it
sleep
twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle--
and
went
on
so
long
that
they
had
to
pinch
it
to
make
it
stop.
well,
i'd
hard
finish
the
first
verse,
said
the
hatter,
when
the
queen
jump
up
and
bawl
out,
"he
murder
the
time!
off
with
his
head!"
how
dread
savage!
exclaim
alice.
and
ever
sinc
that,
the
hatter
went
on
in
a
mourn
tone,
he
won't
do
a
thing
i
ask!
it
alway
six
o'clock
now.
a
bright
idea
came
into
alic
head.
is
that
the
reason
so
mani
tea-th
are
put
out
here?
she
asked.
yes,
that
it,
said
the
hatter
with
a
sigh:
it
alway
tea-time,
and
we'v
no
time
to
wash
the
thing
between
whiles.
then
you
keep
move
round,
i
suppose?
said
alice.
exact
so,
said
the
hatter:
as
the
thing
get
use
up.
but
what
happen
when
you
come
to
the
begin
again?
alic
ventur
to
ask.
suppos
we
chang
the
subject,
the
march
hare
interrupted,
yawning.
i'm
get
tire
of
this.
i
vote
the
young
ladi
tell
us
a
story.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
one,
said
alice,
rather
alarm
at
the
proposal.
then
the
dormous
shall!
they
both
cried.
wake
up,
dormouse!
and
they
pinch
it
on
both
side
at
once.
the
dormous
slowli
open
his
eyes.
'i
wasn't
asleep,
he
said
in
a
hoarse,
feebl
voice:
'i
heard
everi
word
you
fellow
were
saying.
tell
us
a
story!
said
the
march
hare.
yes,
pleas
do!
plead
alice.
and
be
quick
about
it,
ad
the
hatter,
or
you'll
be
asleep
again
befor
it
done.
onc
upon
a
time
there
were
three
littl
sisters,
the
dormous
began
in
a
great
hurry;
and
their
name
were
elsie,
lacie,
and
tillie;
and
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well--
what
did
they
live
on?
said
alice,
who
alway
took
a
great
interest
in
question
of
eat
and
drinking.
they
live
on
treacle,
said
the
dormouse,
after
think
a
minut
or
two.
they
couldn't
have
done
that,
you
know,
alic
gentl
remarked;
they'd
have
been
ill.
so
they
were,
said
the
dormouse;
veri
ill.
alic
tri
to
fanci
to
herself
what
such
an
extraordinari
way
of
live
would
be
like,
but
it
puzzl
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on:
but
whi
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?
take
some
more
tea,
the
march
hare
said
to
alice,
veri
earnestly.
i'v
had
noth
yet,
alic
repli
in
an
offend
tone,
so
i
can't
take
more.
you
mean
you
can't
take
less,
said
the
hatter:
it
veri
easi
to
take
more
than
nothing.
nobodi
ask
your
opinion,
said
alice.
who
make
person
remark
now?
the
hatter
ask
triumphantly.
alic
did
not
quit
know
what
to
say
to
this:
so
she
help
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then
turn
to
the
dormouse,
and
repeat
her
question.
whi
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?
the
dormous
again
took
a
minut
or
two
to
think
about
it,
and
then
said,
it
was
a
treacle-well.
there
no
such
thing!
alic
was
begin
veri
angrily,
but
the
hatter
and
the
march
hare
went
sh!
sh!
and
the
dormous
sulkili
remarked,
if
you
can't
be
civil,
you'd
better
finish
the
stori
for
yourself.
no,
pleas
go
on!
alic
said
veri
humbly;
'i
won't
interrupt
again.
i
dare
say
there
may
be
one.
one,
indeed!
said
the
dormous
indignantly.
however,
he
consent
to
go
on.
and
so
these
three
littl
sisters--they
were
learn
to
draw,
you
know--
what
did
they
draw?
said
alice,
quit
forget
her
promise.
treacle,
said
the
dormouse,
without
consid
at
all
this
time.
'i
want
a
clean
cup,
interrupt
the
hatter:
let
all
move
one
place
on.
he
move
on
as
he
spoke,
and
the
dormous
follow
him:
the
march
hare
move
into
the
dormous
place,
and
alic
rather
unwil
took
the
place
of
the
march
hare.
the
hatter
was
the
onli
one
who
got
ani
advantag
from
the
change:
and
alic
was
a
good
deal
wors
off
than
before,
as
the
march
hare
had
just
upset
the
milk-jug
into
his
plate.
alic
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
dormous
again,
so
she
began
veri
cautiously:
but
i
don't
understand.
where
did
they
draw
the
treacl
from?
you
can
draw
water
out
of
a
water-well,
said
the
hatter;
so
i
should
think
you
could
draw
treacl
out
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
stupid?
but
they
were
in
the
well,
alic
said
to
the
dormouse,
not
choos
to
notic
this
last
remark.
of
cours
they
were',
said
the
dormouse;
--well
in.
this
answer
so
confus
poor
alice,
that
she
let
the
dormous
go
on
for
some
time
without
interrupt
it.
they
were
learn
to
draw,
the
dormous
went
on,
yawn
and
rub
it
eyes,
for
it
was
get
veri
sleepy;
and
they
drew
all
manner
of
things--everyth
that
begin
with
an
m--
whi
with
an
m?
said
alice.
whi
not?
said
the
march
hare.
alic
was
silent.
the
dormous
had
close
it
eye
by
this
time,
and
was
go
off
into
a
doze;
but,
on
be
pinch
by
the
hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
littl
shriek,
and
went
on:
--that
begin
with
an
m,
such
as
mouse-traps,
and
the
moon,
and
memory,
and
muchness--you
know
you
say
thing
are
"much
of
a
muchness"--did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
as
a
draw
of
a
muchness?
really,
now
you
ask
me,
said
alice,
veri
much
confused,
'i
don't
think--
then
you
shouldn't
talk,
said
the
hatter.
this
piec
of
rude
was
more
than
alic
could
bear:
she
got
up
in
great
disgust,
and
walk
off;
the
dormous
fell
asleep
instantly,
and
neither
of
the
other
took
the
least
notic
of
her
going,
though
she
look
back
onc
or
twice,
half
hope
that
they
would
call
after
her:
the
last
time
she
saw
them,
they
were
tri
to
put
the
dormous
into
the
teapot.
at
ani
rate
i'll
never
go
there
again!
said
alic
as
she
pick
her
way
through
the
wood.
it
the
stupidest
tea-parti
i
ever
was
at
in
all
my
life!
just
as
she
said
this,
she
notic
that
one
of
the
tree
had
a
door
lead
right
into
it.
that
veri
curious!
she
thought.
but
everyth
curious
today.
i
think
i
may
as
well
go
in
at
once.
and
in
she
went.
onc
more
she
found
herself
in
the
long
hall,
and
close
to
the
littl
glass
table.
now,
i'll
manag
better
this
time,
she
said
to
herself,
and
began
by
take
the
littl
golden
key,
and
unlock
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden.
then
she
went
to
work
nibbl
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
kept
a
piec
of
it
in
her
pocket)
till
she
was
about
a
foot
high:
then
she
walk
down
the
littl
passage:
and
then--sh
found
herself
at
last
in
the
beauti
garden,
among
the
bright
flower-b
and
the
cool
fountains.
chapter
viii.
the
queen
croquet-ground
a
larg
rose-tre
stood
near
the
entranc
of
the
garden:
the
rose
grow
on
it
were
white,
but
there
were
three
garden
at
it,
busili
paint
them
red.
alic
thought
this
a
veri
curious
thing,
and
she
went
nearer
to
watch
them,
and
just
as
she
came
up
to
them
she
heard
one
of
them
say,
look
out
now,
five!
don't
go
splash
paint
over
me
like
that!
'i
couldn't
help
it,
said
five,
in
a
sulki
tone;
seven
jog
my
elbow.
on
which
seven
look
up
and
said,
that
right,
five!
alway
lay
the
blame
on
others!
you'd
better
not
talk!
said
five.
'i
heard
the
queen
say
onli
yesterday
you
deserv
to
be
beheaded!
what
for?
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
first.
that
none
of
your
business,
two!
said
seven.
yes,
it
is
his
business!
said
five,
and
i'll
tell
him--it
was
for
bring
the
cook
tulip-root
instead
of
onions.
seven
flung
down
his
brush,
and
had
just
begun
well,
of
all
the
unjust
things--
when
his
eye
chanc
to
fall
upon
alice,
as
she
stood
watch
them,
and
he
check
himself
suddenly:
the
other
look
round
also,
and
all
of
them
bow
low.
would
you
tell
me,
said
alice,
a
littl
timidly,
whi
you
are
paint
those
roses?
five
and
seven
said
nothing,
but
look
at
two.
two
began
in
a
low
voice,
whi
the
fact
is,
you
see,
miss,
this
here
ought
to
have
been
a
red
rose-tree,
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
the
queen
was
to
find
it
out,
we
should
all
have
our
head
cut
off,
you
know.
so
you
see,
miss,
we'r
do
our
best,
afor
she
comes,
to--
at
this
moment
five,
who
had
been
anxious
look
across
the
garden,
call
out
the
queen!
the
queen!
and
the
three
garden
instant
threw
themselv
flat
upon
their
faces.
there
was
a
sound
of
mani
footsteps,
and
alic
look
round,
eager
to
see
the
queen.
first
came
ten
soldier
carri
clubs;
these
were
all
shape
like
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
hand
and
feet
at
the
corners:
next
the
ten
courtiers;
these
were
ornament
all
over
with
diamonds,
and
walk
two
and
two,
as
the
soldier
did.
after
these
came
the
royal
children;
there
were
ten
of
them,
and
the
littl
dear
came
jump
merrili
along
hand
in
hand,
in
couples:
they
were
all
ornament
with
hearts.
next
came
the
guests,
most
king
and
queens,
and
among
them
alic
recognis
the
white
rabbit:
it
was
talk
in
a
hurri
nervous
manner,
smile
at
everyth
that
was
said,
and
went
by
without
notic
her.
then
follow
the
knave
of
hearts,
carri
the
king
crown
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
this
grand
procession,
came
the
king
and
queen
of
hearts.
alic
was
rather
doubt
whether
she
ought
not
to
lie
down
on
her
face
like
the
three
gardeners,
but
she
could
not
rememb
ever
have
heard
of
such
a
rule
at
processions;
and
besides,
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
procession,
thought
she,
if
peopl
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
their
faces,
so
that
they
couldn't
see
it?
so
she
stood
still
where
she
was,
and
waited.
when
the
process
came
opposit
to
alice,
they
all
stop
and
look
at
her,
and
the
queen
said
sever
who
is
this?
she
said
it
to
the
knave
of
hearts,
who
onli
bow
and
smile
in
reply.
idiot!
said
the
queen,
toss
her
head
impatiently;
and,
turn
to
alice,
she
went
on,
what
your
name,
child?
my
name
is
alice,
so
pleas
your
majesty,
said
alic
veri
politely;
but
she
added,
to
herself,
why,
they'r
onli
a
pack
of
cards,
after
all.
i
needn't
be
afraid
of
them!
and
who
are
these?
said
the
queen,
point
to
the
three
garden
who
were
lie
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
as
they
were
lie
on
their
faces,
and
the
pattern
on
their
back
was
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
pack,
she
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
gardeners,
or
soldiers,
or
courtiers,
or
three
of
her
own
children.
how
should
i
know?
said
alice,
surpris
at
her
own
courage.
it
no
busi
of
mine.
the
queen
turn
crimson
with
fury,
and,
after
glare
at
her
for
a
moment
like
a
wild
beast,
scream
off
with
her
head!
off--
nonsense!
said
alice,
veri
loud
and
decidedly,
and
the
queen
was
silent.
the
king
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm,
and
timid
said
consider,
my
dear:
she
is
onli
a
child!
the
queen
turn
angrili
away
from
him,
and
said
to
the
knave
turn
them
over!
the
knave
did
so,
veri
carefully,
with
one
foot.
get
up!
said
the
queen,
in
a
shrill,
loud
voice,
and
the
three
garden
instant
jump
up,
and
began
bow
to
the
king,
the
queen,
the
royal
children,
and
everybodi
else.
leav
off
that!
scream
the
queen.
you
make
me
giddy.
and
then,
turn
to
the
rose-tree,
she
went
on,
what
have
you
been
do
here?
may
it
pleas
your
majesty,
said
two,
in
a
veri
humbl
tone,
go
down
on
one
knee
as
he
spoke,
we
were
trying--
'i
see!
said
the
queen,
who
had
meanwhil
been
examin
the
roses.
off
with
their
heads!
and
the
process
move
on,
three
of
the
soldier
remain
behind
to
execut
the
unfortun
gardeners,
who
ran
to
alic
for
protection.
you
shan't
be
beheaded!
said
alice,
and
she
put
them
into
a
larg
flower-pot
that
stood
near.
the
three
soldier
wander
about
for
a
minut
or
two,
look
for
them,
and
then
quiet
march
off
after
the
others.
are
their
head
off?
shout
the
queen.
their
head
are
gone,
if
it
pleas
your
majesty!
the
soldier
shout
in
reply.
that
right!
shout
the
queen.
can
you
play
croquet?
the
soldier
were
silent,
and
look
at
alice,
as
the
question
was
evid
meant
for
her.
yes!
shout
alice.
come
on,
then!
roar
the
queen,
and
alic
join
the
procession,
wonder
veri
much
what
would
happen
next.
it's--it
a
veri
fine
day!
said
a
timid
voic
at
her
side.
she
was
walk
by
the
white
rabbit,
who
was
peep
anxious
into
her
face.
very,
said
alice:
--where
the
duchess?
hush!
hush!
said
the
rabbit
in
a
low,
hurri
tone.
he
look
anxious
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke,
and
then
rais
himself
upon
tiptoe,
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear,
and
whisper
she
under
sentenc
of
execution.
what
for?
said
alice.
did
you
say
"what
a
pity!"?
the
rabbit
asked.
no,
i
didn't,
said
alice:
'i
don't
think
it
at
all
a
pity.
i
said
"what
for?"
she
box
the
queen
ears--
the
rabbit
began.
alic
gave
a
littl
scream
of
laughter.
oh,
hush!
the
rabbit
whisper
in
a
frighten
tone.
the
queen
will
hear
you!
you
see,
she
came
rather
late,
and
the
queen
said--
get
to
your
places!
shout
the
queen
in
a
voic
of
thunder,
and
peopl
began
run
about
in
all
directions,
tumbl
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
settl
down
in
a
minut
or
two,
and
the
game
began.
alic
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
life;
it
was
all
ridg
and
furrows;
the
ball
were
live
hedgehogs,
the
mallet
live
flamingoes,
and
the
soldier
had
to
doubl
themselv
up
and
to
stand
on
their
hand
and
feet,
to
make
the
arches.
the
chief
difficulti
alic
found
at
first
was
in
manag
her
flamingo:
she
succeed
in
get
it
bodi
tuck
away,
comfort
enough,
under
her
arm,
with
it
leg
hang
down,
but
generally,
just
as
she
had
got
it
neck
nice
straighten
out,
and
was
go
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
it
head,
it
would
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
face,
with
such
a
puzzl
express
that
she
could
not
help
burst
out
laughing:
and
when
she
had
got
it
head
down,
and
was
go
to
begin
again,
it
was
veri
provok
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
unrol
itself,
and
was
in
the
act
of
crawl
away:
besid
all
this,
there
was
general
a
ridg
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherev
she
want
to
send
the
hedgehog
to,
and,
as
the
doubled-up
soldier
were
alway
get
up
and
walk
off
to
other
part
of
the
ground,
alic
soon
came
to
the
conclus
that
it
was
a
veri
difficult
game
indeed.
the
player
all
play
at
onc
without
wait
for
turns,
quarrel
all
the
while,
and
fight
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
a
veri
short
time
the
queen
was
in
a
furious
passion,
and
went
stamp
about,
and
shout
off
with
his
head!
or
off
with
her
head!
about
onc
in
a
minute.
alic
began
to
feel
veri
uneasy:
to
be
sure,
she
had
not
as
yet
had
ani
disput
with
the
queen,
but
she
knew
that
it
might
happen
ani
minute,
and
then,
thought
she,
what
would
becom
of
me?
they'r
dread
fond
of
behead
peopl
here;
the
great
wonder
is,
that
there
ani
one
left
alive!
she
was
look
about
for
some
way
of
escape,
and
wonder
whether
she
could
get
away
without
be
seen,
when
she
notic
a
curious
appear
in
the
air:
it
puzzl
her
veri
much
at
first,
but,
after
watch
it
a
minut
or
two,
she
made
it
out
to
be
a
grin,
and
she
said
to
herself
it
the
cheshir
cat:
now
i
shall
have
somebodi
to
talk
to.
how
are
you
get
on?
said
the
cat,
as
soon
as
there
was
mouth
enough
for
it
to
speak
with.
alic
wait
till
the
eye
appeared,
and
then
nodded.
it
no
use
speak
to
it,
she
thought,

or
at
least
one
of
them.
in
anoth
minut
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
alic
put
down
her
flamingo,
and
began
an
account
of
the
game,
feel
veri
glad
she
had
someon
to
listen
to
her.
the
cat
seem
to
think
that
there
was
enough
of
it
now
in
sight,
and
no
more
of
it
appeared.
'i
don't
think
they
play
at
all
fairly,
alic
began,
in
rather
a
complain
tone,
and
they
all
quarrel
so
dread
one
can't
hear
oneself
speak--and
they
don't
seem
to
have
ani
rule
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
are,
nobodi
attend
to
them--and
you'v
no
idea
how
confus
it
is
all
the
thing
be
alive;
for
instance,
there
the
arch
i'v
got
to
go
through
next
walk
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground--and
i
should
have
croquet
the
queen
hedgehog
just
now,
onli
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
coming!
how
do
you
like
the
queen?
said
the
cat
in
a
low
voice.
not
at
all,
said
alice:
she
so
extremely--
just
then
she
notic
that
the
queen
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
went
on,
--like
to
win,
that
it
hard
worth
while
finish
the
game.
the
queen
smile
and
pass
on.
who
are
you
talk
to?
said
the
king,
go
up
to
alice,
and
look
at
the
cat
head
with
great
curiosity.
it
a
friend
of
mine--a
cheshir
cat,
said
alice:
allow
me
to
introduc
it.
'i
don't
like
the
look
of
it
at
all,
said
the
king:
however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
likes.
i'd
rather
not,
the
cat
remarked.
don't
be
impertinent,
said
the
king,
and
don't
look
at
me
like
that!
he
got
behind
alic
as
he
spoke.
'a
cat
may
look
at
a
king,
said
alice.
i'v
read
that
in
some
book,
but
i
don't
rememb
where.
well,
it
must
be
removed,
said
the
king
veri
decidedly,
and
he
call
the
queen,
who
was
pass
at
the
moment,
my
dear!
i
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
removed!
the
queen
had
onli
one
way
of
settl
all
difficulties,
great
or
small.
off
with
his
head!
she
said,
without
even
look
round.
i'll
fetch
the
execution
myself,
said
the
king
eagerly,
and
he
hurri
off.
alic
thought
she
might
as
well
go
back,
and
see
how
the
game
was
go
on,
as
she
heard
the
queen
voic
in
the
distance,
scream
with
passion.
she
had
alreadi
heard
her
sentenc
three
of
the
player
to
be
execut
for
have
miss
their
turns,
and
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
thing
at
all,
as
the
game
was
in
such
confus
that
she
never
knew
whether
it
was
her
turn
or
not.
so
she
went
in
search
of
her
hedgehog.
the
hedgehog
was
engag
in
a
fight
with
anoth
hedgehog,
which
seem
to
alic
an
excel
opportun
for
croquet
one
of
them
with
the
other:
the
onli
difficulti
was,
that
her
flamingo
was
gone
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden,
where
alic
could
see
it
tri
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
to
fli
up
into
a
tree.
by
the
time
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back,
the
fight
was
over,
and
both
the
hedgehog
were
out
of
sight:
but
it
doesn't
matter
much,
thought
alice,
as
all
the
arch
are
gone
from
this
side
of
the
ground.
so
she
tuck
it
away
under
her
arm,
that
it
might
not
escap
again,
and
went
back
for
a
littl
more
convers
with
her
friend.
when
she
got
back
to
the
cheshir
cat,
she
was
surpris
to
find
quit
a
larg
crowd
collect
round
it:
there
was
a
disput
go
on
between
the
executioner,
the
king,
and
the
queen,
who
were
all
talk
at
once,
while
all
the
rest
were
quit
silent,
and
look
veri
uncomfortable.
the
moment
alic
appeared,
she
was
appeal
to
by
all
three
to
settl
the
question,
and
they
repeat
their
argument
to
her,
though,
as
they
all
spoke
at
once,
she
found
it
veri
hard
inde
to
make
out
exact
what
they
said.
the
execution
argument
was,
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
head
unless
there
was
a
bodi
to
cut
it
off
from:
that
he
had
never
had
to
do
such
a
thing
before,
and
he
wasn't
go
to
begin
at
his
time
of
life.
the
king
argument
was,
that
anyth
that
had
a
head
could
be
beheaded,
and
that
you
weren't
to
talk
nonsense.
the
queen
argument
was,
that
if
someth
wasn't
done
about
it
in
less
than
no
time
she'd
have
everybodi
executed,
all
round.
(it
was
this
last
remark
that
had
made
the
whole
parti
look
so
grave
and
anxious.)
alic
could
think
of
noth
els
to
say
but
it
belong
to
the
duchess:
you'd
better
ask
her
about
it.
she
in
prison,
the
queen
said
to
the
executioner:
fetch
her
here.
and
the
execution
went
off
like
an
arrow.
the
cat
head
began
fade
away
the
moment
he
was
gone,
and,
by
the
time
he
had
come
back
with
the
duchess,
it
had
entir
disappeared;
so
the
king
and
the
execution
ran
wild
up
and
down
look
for
it,
while
the
rest
of
the
parti
went
back
to
the
game.

the
mock

stori
you
can't
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again,
you
dear
old
thing!
said
the
duchess,
as
she
tuck
her
arm
affection
into
alice's,
and
they
walk
off
together.
alic
was
veri
glad
to
find
her
in
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
to
herself
that
perhap
it
was
onli
the
pepper
that
had
made
her
so
savag
when
they
met
in
the
kitchen.
when
i'm
a
duchess,
she
said
to
herself,
(not
in
a
veri
hope
tone
though),
'i
won't
have
ani
pepper
in
my
kitchen
at
all.

went
on,

of

and

that

them
sour--and

that

barley-sugar
and
such
thing
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
i
onli
wish
peopl
knew
that:
then
they
wouldn't
be
so
stingi
about
it,
you
know--
she
had
quit
forgotten
the
duchess
by
this
time,
and
was
a
littl
startl
when
she
heard
her
voic
close
to
her
ear.
you'r
think
about
something,
my
dear,
and
that
make
you
forget
to
talk.
i
can't
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
i
shall
rememb
it
in
a
bit.
perhap
it
hasn't
one,
alic
ventur
to
remark.
tut,
tut,
child!
said
the
duchess.
everyth
got
a
moral,
if
onli
you
can
find
it.
and
she
squeez
herself
up
closer
to
alic
side
as
she
spoke.
alic
did
not
much
like
keep
so
close
to
her:
first,
becaus
the
duchess
was
veri
ugly;
and
secondly,
becaus
she
was
exact
the
right
height
to
rest
her
chin
upon
alic
shoulder,
and
it
was
an
uncomfort
sharp
chin.
however,
she
did
not
like
to
be
rude,
so
she
bore
it
as
well
as
she
could.
the
game
go
on
rather
better
now,
she
said,
by
way
of
keep
up
the
convers
a
little.
'tis
so,
said
the
duchess:
and
the
moral
of
that
is--"oh,
tis
love,
tis
love,
that
make
the
world
go
round!"
somebodi
said,
alic
whispered,
that
it
done
by
everybodi
mind
their
own
business!
ah,
well!
it
mean
much
the
same
thing,
said
the
duchess,
dig
her
sharp
littl
chin
into
alic
shoulder
as
she
added,
and
the
moral
of
that
is--"tak
care
of
the
sense,
and
the
sound
will
take
care
of
themselves."
how
fond
she
is
of
find
moral
in
things!
alic
thought
to
herself.
'i
dare
say
you'r
wonder
whi
i
don't
put
my
arm
round
your
waist,
the
duchess
said
after
a
pause:
the
reason
is,
that
i'm
doubt
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo.
shall
i
tri
the
experiment?
he
might
bite,
alic
cautious
replied,
not
feel
at
all
anxious
to
have
the
experi
tried.
veri
true,
said
the
duchess:
flamingo
and
mustard
both
bite.
and
the
moral
of
that
is--"bird
of
a
feather
flock
together."
on
mustard
isn't
a
bird,
alic
remarked.
right,
as
usual,
said
the
duchess:
what
a
clear
way
you
have
of
put
things!
it
a
mineral,
i
think,
said
alice.
of
cours
it
is,
said
the
duchess,
who
seem
readi
to
agre
to
everyth
that
alic
said;
there
a
larg
mustard-min
near
here.
and
the
moral
of
that
is--"th
more
there
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
of
yours."
oh,
i
know!
exclaim
alice,
who
had
not
attend
to
this
last
remark,
it
a
vegetable.
it
doesn't
look
like
one,
but
it
is.
'i
quit
agre
with
you,
said
the
duchess;
and
the
moral
of
that
is--"b
what
you
would
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
like
it
put
more
simply--"nev
imagin
yourself
not
to

than
what

might
appear
to

or

not
otherwis
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appear
to
them
to
be
otherwise."
'i
think
i
should
understand
that
better,
alic
said
veri
politely,
if
i
had
it
written
down:
but
i
can't
quit
follow
it
as
you
say
it.
that
noth
to
what
i
could
say
if
i
chose,
the
duchess
replied,
in
a
pleas
tone.
pray
don't
troubl
yourself
to
say
it
ani
longer
than
that,
said
alice.
oh,
don't
talk
about
trouble!
said
the
duchess.
'i
make
you
a
present
of
everyth
i'v
said
as
yet.
'a
cheap
sort
of
present!
thought
alice.
i'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
present
like
that!
but
she
did
not
ventur
to
say
it
out
loud.
think
again?
the
duchess
asked,
with
anoth
dig
of
her
sharp
littl
chin.
i'v
a
right
to
think,
said
alic
sharply,
for
she
was
begin
to
feel
a
littl
worried.
just
about
as
much
right,
said
the
duchess,
as
pig
have
to
fly;
and
the
m--
but
here,
to
alic
great
surprise,
the
duchess
voic
die
away,
even
in
the
middl
of
her
favourit
word
moral,
and
the
arm
that
was
link
into
her
began
to
tremble.
alic
look
up,
and
there
stood
the
queen
in
front
of
them,
with
her
arm
folded,
frown
like
a
thunderstorm.
'a
fine
day,
your
majesty!
the
duchess
began
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
now,
i
give
you
fair
warning,
shout
the
queen,
stamp
on
the
ground
as
she
spoke;
either
you
or
your
head
must
be
off,
and
that
in
about
half
no
time!
take
your
choice!
the
duchess
took
her
choice,
and
was
gone
in
a
moment.
let
go
on
with
the
game,
the
queen
said
to
alice;
and
alic
was
too
much
frighten
to
say
a
word,
but
slowli
follow
her
back
to
the
croquet-ground.
the
other
guest
had
taken
advantag
of
the
queen
absence,
and
were
rest
in
the
shade:
however,
the
moment
they
saw
her,
they
hurri
back
to
the
game,
the
queen
mere
remark
that
a
moment
delay
would
cost
them
their
lives.
all
the
time
they
were
play
the
queen
never
left
off
quarrel
with
the
other
players,
and
shout
off
with
his
head!
or
off
with
her
head!
those
whom
she
sentenc
were
taken
into
custodi
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
cours
had
to
leav
off
be
arch
to
do
this,
so
that
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arch
left,
and
all
the
players,
except
the
king,
the
queen,
and
alice,
were
in
custodi
and
under
sentenc
of
execution.
then
the
queen
left
off,
quit
out
of
breath,
and
said
to
alice,
have
you
seen
the
mock
turtl
yet?
no,
said
alice.
'i
don't
even
know
what
a
mock
turtl
is.
it
the
thing
mock
turtl
soup
is
made
from,
said
the
queen.
'i
never
saw
one,
or
heard
of
one,
said
alice.
come
on,
then,
said
the
queen,
and
he
shall
tell
you
his
history,
as
they
walk
off
together,
alic
heard
the
king
say
in
a
low
voice,
to
the
compani
generally,
you
are
all
pardoned.
come,
that
a
good
thing!
she
said
to
herself,
for
she
had
felt
quit
unhappi
at
the
number
of
execut
the
queen
had
ordered.
they
veri
soon
came
upon
a
gryphon,
lie
fast
asleep
in
the
sun.
(if
you
don't
know
what
a
gryphon
is,
look
at
the
picture.)
up,
lazi
thing!
said
the
queen,
and
take
this
young
ladi
to
see
the
mock
turtle,
and
to
hear
his
history.
i
must
go
back
and
see
after
some
execut
i
have
ordered';
and
she
walk
off,
leav
alic
alon
with
the
gryphon.
alic
did
not
quit
like
the
look
of
the
creature,
but
on
the
whole
she
thought
it
would
be
quit
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
to
go
after
that
savag
queen:
so
she
waited.
the
gryphon
sat
up
and
rub
it
eyes:
then
it
watch
the
queen
till
she
was
out
of
sight:
then
it
chuckled.
what
fun!
said
the
gryphon,
half
to
itself,
half
to
alice.
what
is
the
fun?
said
alice.
why,
she,
said
the
gryphon.
it
all
her
fancy,
that:
they
never
execut
nobody,
you
know.
come
on!
everybodi
say
"come
on!"
here,
thought
alice,
as
she
went
slowli
after
it:
'i
never
was
so
order
about
in
all
my
life,
never!
they
had
not
gone
far
befor
they
saw
the
mock
turtl
in
the
distance,
sit
sad
and
lone
on
a
littl
ledg
of
rock,
and,
as
they
came
nearer,
alic
could
hear
him
sigh
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
she
piti
him
deeply.
what
is
his
sorrow?
she
ask
the
gryphon,
and
the
gryphon
answered,
veri
near
in
the
same
word
as
before,
it
all
his
fancy,
that:
he
hasn't
got
no
sorrow,
you
know.
come
on!
so
they
went
up
to
the
mock
turtle,
who
look
at
them
with
larg
eye
full
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
this
here
young
lady,
said
the
gryphon,
she
want
for
to
know
your
history,
she
do.
i'll
tell
it
her,
said
the
mock
turtl
in
a
deep,
hollow
tone:
sit
down,
both
of
you,
and
don't
speak
a
word
till
i'v
finished.
so
they
sat
down,
and
nobodi
spoke
for
some
minutes.
alic
thought
to
herself,
'i
don't
see
how
he
can
even
finish,
if
he
doesn't
begin.
but
she
wait
patiently.
once,
said
the
mock
turtl
at
last,
with
a
deep
sigh,
'i
was
a
real
turtle.
these
word
were
follow
by
a
veri
long
silence,
broken
onli
by
an
occasion
exclam
of
hjckrrh!
from
the
gryphon,
and
the
constant
heavi
sob
of
the
mock
turtle.
alic
was
veri
near
get
up
and
saying,
thank
you,
sir,
for
your
interest
story,
but
she
could
not
help
think
there
must
be
more
to
come,
so
she
sat
still
and
said
nothing.
when
we
were
little,
the
mock
turtl
went
on
at

more
calmly,
though
still
sob
a
littl
now
and
then,
we
went
to
school
in
the
sea.
the
master
was
an
old
turtle--w
use
to
call
him
tortoise--
whi
did
you
call
him
tortoise,
if
he
wasn't
one?
alic
asked.
we
call
him
tortois
becaus
he
taught
us,
said
the
mock
turtl
angrily:

such
a

ad
the
gryphon;
and
then
they
both
sat
silent
and
look
at
poor
alice,
who
felt
readi
to
sink
into
the
earth.
at
last
the
gryphon
said
to
the
mock
turtle,
drive
on,
old
fellow!
don't
be
all
day
about
it!
and
he
went
on
in
these
words:
yes,
we
went
to
school
in
the
sea,
though
you
mayn't
believ
it--
'i

alice.

said
the
mock
turtle.

ad
the
gryphon,
befor
alic
could
speak
again.
the
mock
turtl
went
on.
we
had
the
best
of
educations--in
fact,
we
went
to
school
everi
day--
i'v
been
to
a
day-school,
too,
said
alice;
you
needn't
be
so
proud
as
all
that.

ask
the
mock
turtl
a
littl
anxiously.
yes,
said
alice,
we

french
and
music.
and
washing?
said
the
mock
turtle.
certain
not!
said
alic
indignantly.
ah!
then
your
wasn't
a
realli
good
school,
said
the
mock
turtl
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.

they
had
at

said
alice;

'i

the

with
a

the
mock

replied;
and
then
the
differ

of
arithmetic--ambition,
distraction,
uglification,
and
derision.
'i
never

of
"uglification,"
alic
ventur
to

what
is
it?
the
gryphon
lift
up

it
exclaimed.
you
know
what
to
beautifi
is,
i
suppose?
yes,
said
alic
doubtfully:
it
means--to--make--anything--prettier.
well,
then,
the
gryphon
went
on,
if
you
don't
know
what
to
uglifi
is,
you
are
a
simpleton.
alic
did
not
feel
encourag
to
ask
ani

question
about
it,
so
she
turn
to
the
mock
turtle,
and
said
what
els
had
you
to
learn?
well,
there
was
mystery,
the
mock
turtl
replied,
count
off
the
subject
on
his
flappers,
--mystery,
ancient
and
modern,
with

then
drawling--th

an

that

to

onc
a

he
taught
us
drawling,
stretching,
and

in
coils.
what
was
that
like?
said
alice.
well,
i
can't

the
mock

said:
i'm
too
stiff.
and
the
gryphon
never
learnt
it.

said
the
gryphon:
'i

he
was
an
old

he
was.
'i
never
went
to
him,
the
mock

said
with
a
sigh:
he
taught
laugh
and
grief,
they
use
to
say.
so
he
did,
so
he
did,
said
the
gryphon,
sigh
in
his

and
both
creatur
hid
their
face
in
their

and
how

alice,
in

alice.
that
the
reason

call

the
gryphon
remarked:
becaus
they
lessen
from

to

this
was
quit
a

to
alice,
and
she
thought

the

sat
down
again
veri

and
quietly,

so
they

then
tread
on

'i

the

if

so
often,

you
know
what
they'r

'i

about
the

said
the

but
they

her
about

and
all
that,
he
said
to

the
reason
is,
said
the
gryphon,
that
they
would
go
with
the
lobster
to

dance.
so
they
got
thrown
out
to

so
they
had
to

all.

you,
said
alice,

'i

in

the

repli
rather
impatiently:

if

the

said
alice,
whose

have

to
the

"keep

said
alic
in
a

the

told

'i

hear
some
of

'i

so
alic
began

her

from
the
time

saw

she
was
a

alice;
'i

however,
she
got
up,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
was
so
full
of
the
lobster
quadrille,
that
she
hard
knew
what
she
was
saying,
and
the
word
came
veri
queer
indeed:--
'tis

chapter
xi.
who
stole
the
tarts?
the
king
and
queen
of
heart
were
seat
on
their
throne
when
they
arrived,
with
a
great
crowd
assembl
about
them--al
sort
of
littl
bird
and
beasts,
as
well
as
the
whole
pack
of
cards:
the
knave
was
stand
befor
them,
in
chains,
with
a
soldier
on
each
side
to
guard
him;
and
near
the
king
was
the
white
rabbit,
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand,
and
a
scroll
of
parchment
in
the
other.
in
the
veri
middl
of
the
court
was
a
table,
with
a
larg
dish
of
tart
upon
it:
they
look
so
good,
that
it
made
alic
quit
hungri
to
look
at
them--'i
wish
they'd
get
the
trial
done,
she
thought,
and
hand
round
the
refreshments!
but
there
seem
to
be
no
chanc
of
this,
so
she
began
look
at
everyth
about
her,
to
pass
away
the
time.
alic
had
never
been
in
a
court
of
justic
before,
but
she
had
read
about
them
in
books,
and
she
was
quit
pleas
to
find
that
she
knew
the
name
of
near
everyth
there.
that
the
judge,
she
said
to
herself,
becaus
of
his
great
wig.
the
judge,
by
the
way,
was
the
king;
and
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
wig,
(look
at
the
frontispiec
if
you
want
to
see
how
he
did
it,)
he
did
not
look
at
all
comfortable,
and
it
was
certain
not
becoming.
and
that
the
jury-box,
thought
alice,
and
those
twelv
creatures,
(she
was
oblig
to
say
creatures,
you
see,
becaus
some
of
them
were
animals,
and
some
were
birds,)
'i
suppos
they
are
the
jurors.
she
said
this
last
word
two
or
three
time
over
to
herself,
be
rather
proud
of
it:
for
she
thought,
and
right
too,
that
veri
few
littl
girl
of
her
age
knew
the
mean
of
it
at
all.
however,
jury-men
would
have
done
just
as
well.
the
twelv
juror
were
all
write
veri
busili
on
slates.
what
are
they
doing?
alic
whisper
to
the
gryphon.
they
can't
have
anyth
to
put
down
yet,
befor
the
trial
begun.
they'r
put
down
their
names,
the
gryphon
whisper
in
reply,
for
fear
they
should
forget
them
befor
the
end
of
the
trial.
stupid
things!
alic
began
in
a
loud,
indign
voice,
but
she
stop
hastily,
for
the
white
rabbit
cri
out,
silenc
in
the
court!
and
the
king
put
on
his
spectacl
and
look
anxious
round,
to
make
out
who
was
talking.
alic
could
see,
as
well
as
if
she
were
look
over
their
shoulders,
that
all
the
juror
were
write
down
stupid
things!
on
their
slates,
and
she
could
even
make
out
that
one
of
them
didn't
know
how
to
spell
stupid,
and
that
he
had
to
ask
his
neighbour
to
tell
him.
'a
nice
muddl
their
slates'l
be
in
befor
the
trial
over!
thought
alice.
one
of
the
juror
had
a
pencil
that
squeaked.
this
of
course,
alic
could
not
stand,
and
she
went
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him,
and
veri
soon
found
an
opportun
of
take
it
away.
she
did
it
so
quick
that
the
poor
littl
juror
(it
was
bill,
the
lizard)
could
not
make
out
at
all
what
had
becom
of
it;
so,
after
hunt
all
about
for
it,
he
was
oblig
to
write
with
one
finger
for
the
rest
of
the
day;
and
this
was
of
veri
littl
use,
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
slate.
herald,
read
the
accusation!
said
the
king.
on
this
the
white
rabbit
blew
three
blast
on
the
trumpet,
and
then
unrol
the
parchment
scroll,
and
read
as
follows:--
the
queen
of
hearts,
she
made
some
tarts,
all
on
a
summer
day:
the
knave
of
hearts,
he
stole
those
tarts,
and
took
them
quit
away!

your
verdict,
the
king
said
to
the
jury.

not
yet!
the
rabbit
hastili
interrupted.
there
a
great
deal
to
come
befor
that!
call
the
first
witness,
said
the
king;
and
the
white
rabbit
blew
three
blast
on
the
trumpet,
and
call
out,
first
witness!
the
first
wit
was
the
hatter.
he
came
in
with
a
teacup
in
one
hand
and
a
piec
of
bread-and-butt
in
the
other.
'i
beg
pardon,
your
majesty,
he
began,
for
bring
these
in:
but
i
hadn't
quit
finish
my
tea
when
i
was
sent
for.
you
ought
to
have
finished,
said
the
king.
when
did
you
begin?
the
hatter
look
at
the
march
hare,
who
had
follow
him
into
the
court,
arm-in-arm
with
the
dormouse.

i
think
it
was,
he
said.
fifteenth,
said
the
march
hare.
sixteenth,
ad
the
dormouse.
write
that
down,
the
king
said
to
the
jury,
and
the
juri
eager
wrote
down
all
three
date
on
their
slates,
and
then
ad
them
up,
and
reduc
the
answer
to
shill
and
pence.
take
off
your
hat,
the
king
said
to
the
hatter.
it
isn't
mine,
said
the
hatter.
stolen!
the
king
exclaimed,
turn
to
the
jury,
who
instant
made
a
memorandum
of
the
fact.
'i
keep
them
to
sell,
the
hatter
ad
as
an
explanation;
i'v
none
of
my
own.
i'm
a
hatter.
here
the
queen
put
on
her
spectacles,
and
began
stare
at
the
hatter,
who
turn
pale
and
fidgeted.
give
your
evidence,
said
the
king;
and
don't
be
nervous,
or
i'll
have
you
execut
on
the
spot.
this
did
not
seem
to
encourag
the
wit
at
all:
he
kept
shift
from
one
foot
to
the
other,
look
uneasili
at
the
queen,
and
in
his
confus
he
bit
a
larg
piec
out
of
his
teacup
instead
of
the
bread-and-butter.
just
at
this
moment
alic
felt
a
veri
curious
sensation,
which
puzzl
her
a
good
deal
until
she
made
out
what
it
was:
she
was
begin
to
grow
larger
again,
and
she
thought
at
first
she
would
get
up
and
leav
the
court;
but
on
second
thought
she
decid
to
remain
where
she
was
as
long
as
there
was
room
for
her.
'i
wish
you
wouldn't
squeez
so.
said
the
dormouse,
who
was
sit
next
to
her.
'i
can
hard
breathe.
'i
can't
help
it,
said
alic
veri
meekly:
i'm
growing.
you'v
no
right
to
grow
here,
said
the
dormouse.
don't
talk
nonsense,
said
alic
more
boldly:
you
know
you'r
grow
too.
yes,
but
i
grow
at
a
reason
pace,
said
the
dormouse:
not
in
that
ridicul
fashion.
and
he
got
up
veri
sulkili
and
cross
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
court.
all
this
time
the
queen
had
never
left
off
stare
at
the
hatter,
and,
just
as
the
dormous
cross
the
court,
she
said
to
one
of
the
offic
of
the
court,
bring
me
the
list
of

on

so,
that

the
king
repeat
angrily,
or
i'll
have
you
executed,
whether
you'r
nervous
or
not.
i'm
a
poor
man,
your
majesty,
the
hatter
began,
in
a
trembl
voice,
--and
i
hadn't

or
so--and

the

sharply.

i'm

the
hatter
went

after

'i

said
the

'i

said
the
king:

well,

the
dormous
said--
the
hatter

on,
look
anxious
round
to
see
if
he
would
deni
it
too:
but
the
dormous
deni
nothing,

after
that,
continu
the
hatter,
'i
cut
some
more

but
what
did
the

say?
one
of
the
juri
asked.
that

said
the
hatter.

remark
the
king,
or
i'll
have
you
executed.
the
miser
hatter
drop
his

and
bread-and-butter,
and
went
down
on
one
knee.
i'm
a
poor
man,
your

he
began.

the

(as
that
is
rather
a
hard
word,
i
will
just
explain
to
you
how
it
was
done.
they
had
a

which
tie
up
at
the
mouth
with
strings:
into
this
they
slip
the
guinea-pig,
head
first,
and
then
sat
upon
it.)
i'm
glad
i'v
seen
that
done,
thought
alice.
i'v
so
often
read
in

continu
the

'i
can't

no

said
the
hatter:
i'm
on
the

as
it
is.
then
you
may
sit

the
king
replied.
here
the

thought
alice.
now
we
shall
get
on
better.
i'd

said
the
hatter,
with
an
anxious
look
at
the
queen,
who
was

said
the

he
said
to

in
a
low,

voice.

said
the

rabbit,

up
in

what
in

said
the
queen.
'i
haven't
open
it
yet,
said
the
white
rabbit,
but
it
seem
to
be
a
letter,
written
by
the
prison
to--to
somebody.
it
must
have
been
that,
said
the
king,
unless
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.
who
is

to?
said
one
of

jurymen.
it
isn't

at

said
the
white
rabbit;
in

there
noth
written
on

outside.
he
unfold
the
paper
as
he
spoke,
and
ad
it
isn't
a
letter,
after
all:
it
a
set
of
verses.
are
they
in
the
prison
handwriting?
ask
anoth
of
the
jurymen.
no,
they'r
not,
said
the
white
rabbit,
and
that
the
queerest
thing
about
it.
(the
juri
all
look
puzzled.)
he
must
have
imit
somebodi
els

said
the
king.
(the
juri
all
brighten
up
again.)
pleas
your
majesty,
said
the
knave,
'i
didn't
write
it,
and
they
can't

i
did:
there
no

if

the

you

or
els
you'd

there
was
a
general
clap
of
hand
at
this:
it
was
the
first
realli
clever
thing
the
king
had
said
that
day.
that
prove

guilt,
said
the
queen.
it
prove
noth
of
the
sort!
said
alice.
why,
you
don't
even
know
what
they'r
about!
read
them,
said
the
king.
the
white
rabbit
put
on
his
spectacles.
where
shall
i
begin,
pleas
your
majesty?
he
asked.
begin
at
the
beginning,
the
king
said
gravely,
and
go
on
till
you
come
to
the
end:
then
stop.
these
were
the
vers
the
white
rabbit
read:--
they
told
me
you
had
been
to
her,
and
mention
me
to
him:
she
gave
me
a
good
character,
but
said
i
could
not
swim.
he
sent
them
word
i
had
not
gone
(we
know
it
to
be
true):
if
she
should
push
the
matter
on,
what
would
becom
of
you?
i
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two,
you
gave
us
three
or
more;
they
all
return
from
him
to
you,
though
they
were
mine
before.
if
i
or
she
should
chanc
to
be
involv
in
this
affair,
he
trust
to
you
to
set
them
free,
exact
as
we
were.
my
notion
was
that
you
had
been
(befor
she
had
this
fit)
an
obstacl
that
came
between
him,
and
ourselves,
and
it.
don't
let
him
know
she
like
them
best,
for
this
must
ever
be
a
secret,
kept
from
all
the
rest,
between
yourself
and
me.
that
the
most
import
piec
of
evid
we'v
heard
yet,
said
the
king,
rub
his
hands;
so
now
let
the
jury--
if
ani
one
of
them
can
explain
it,
said
alice,
(she
had
grown
so
larg
in
the
last
few
minut
that
she
wasn't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupt
him,)
i'll
give
him
sixpence.
_i_
don't
believ
there
an
atom
of
mean
in
it.
the
juri
all
wrote
down
on
their
slates,
she
doesn't
believ
there
an
atom
of
mean
in
it,
but
none
of
them
attempt
to
explain
the
paper.
if
there
no
mean
in
it,
said
the
king,
that
save
a
world
of
trouble,
you
know,
as
we
needn't
tri
to
find
any.
and
yet
i
don't
know,
he
went
on,
spread
out
the
vers
on
his
knee,
and
look
at
them
with
one
eye;
'i
seem
to
see
some
mean
in
them,
after
all.
"--said
i
could
not
swim--"
you
can't
swim,
can
you?
he
added,
turn
to
the
knave.
the
knave
shook
his
head
sadly.
do
i
look
like
it?
he
said.
(which
he
certain
did
not,
be
made
entir
of
cardboard.)
all
right,
so
far,
said
the
king,
and
he
went
on
mutter
over
the
vers
to
himself:
"we
know
it
to
be
true--"
that
the
jury,
of
course--"i
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two--"
why,
that
must
be
what
he
did
with
the
tarts,
you
know--
but,
it
goe
on
"they
all
return
from
him
to
you,"
said
alice.
why,
there
they
are!
said
the
king
triumphantly,
point
to
the
tart
on
the
table.
noth
can
be
clearer
than
that.
then
again--"befor
she
had
this
fit--"
you
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
i
think?
he
said
to
the
queen.
never!
said
the
queen
furiously,
throw
an
inkstand
at
the
lizard
as
she
spoke.
(the
unfortun
littl
bill
had
left
off
write
on
his
slate
with
one
finger,
as
he
found
it
made
no
mark;
but
he
now
hastili
began
again,
use
the
ink,
that
was
trickl
down
his
face,
as
long
as
it
lasted.)
then
the
word
don't
fit
you,
said
the
king,
look
round
the
court
with
a
smile.
there
was
a
dead
silence.
it
a
pun!
the
king
ad
in
an
offend
tone,
and
everybodi
laughed,
let
the
juri
consid
their
verdict,
the
king
said,
for
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.

said
the
queen.

said
the

'i

the
queen
shout
at
the
top
of
her
voice.
nobodi

who
care
for

said
alice,
(she
had
grown
to
her
full
size
by
this
time.)
you'r
noth
but
a
pack
of
cards!
at
this
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
air,
and
came
fli
down
upon
her:
she
gave
a
littl
scream,
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger,
and
tri
to
beat
them
off,
and
found
herself
lie
on
the
bank,
with
her
head
in
the
lap
of
her
sister,
who
was
gentl
brush
away
some
dead
leav
that
had
flutter
down
from
the
tree
upon
her
face.
wake
up,
alic
dear!
said
her
sister;
why,
what
a
long
sleep
you'v
had!
oh,
i'v
had
such
a
curious
dream!
said
alice,
and
she
told
her
sister,
as
well
as
she
could
rememb
them,
all
these
strang
adventur
of
her
that
you
have
just
been
read
about;
and
when
she
had
finished,
her
sister
kiss
her,
and
said,
it
was
a
curious
dream,
dear,
certainly:
but
now
run
in
to
your
tea;
it
get
late.
so
alic
got
up
and
ran
off,
think
while
she
ran,
as
well
she
might,
what
a
wonder
dream
it
had
been.
but
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
she
left
her,
lean
her
head
on
her
hand,
watch
the
set
sun,
and
think
of
littl
alic
and
all
her
wonder
adventures,
till
she
too
began
dream
after
a
fashion,
and
this
was
her
dream:--
first,
she
dream
of
littl
alic
herself,
and
onc
again
the
tini
hand
were
clasp
upon
her
knee,
and
the
bright
eager
eye
were
look
up
into
hers--sh
could
hear
the
veri
tone
of
her
voice,
and
see
that
queer
littl
toss
of
her
head
to
keep
back
the
wander
hair
that
would
alway
get
into
her
eyes--and
still
as
she
listened,
or
seem
to
listen,
the
whole
place
around
her
becam
aliv
with
the
strang
creatur
of
her
littl
sister
dream.
the
long
grass
rustl
at
her
feet
as
the
white
rabbit
hurri
by--th
frighten
mous
splash
his
way
through
the
neighbour
pool--sh
could
hear
the
rattl
of
the
teacup
as
the
march
hare
and
his
friend
share
their
never-end
meal,
and
the
shrill
voic
of
the
queen
order
off
her
unfortun
guest
to
execution--onc
more
the
pig-babi
was
sneez
on
the
duchess
knee,
while
plate
and
dish
crash
around
it--onc
more
the
shriek
of
the
gryphon,
the
squeak
of
the
lizard
slate-pencil,
and
the
choke
of
the
suppress
guinea-pigs,
fill
the
air,
mix
up
with
the
distant
sob
of
the
miser
mock
turtle.
so
she
sat
on,
with
close
eyes,
and
half
believ
herself
in
wonderland,
though
she
knew
she
had
but
to
open
them
again,
and
all
would
chang
to
dull
reality--th
grass
would
be
onli
rustl
in
the
wind,
and
the
pool
rippl
to
the
wave
of
the
reeds--th
rattl
teacup
would
chang
to
tinkl
sheep-bells,
and
the
queen
shrill
cri
to
the
voic
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
the
sneez
of
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
gryphon,
and
all
the
other
queer
noises,
would
chang
(she
knew)
to
the
confus
clamour
of
the
busi
farm-yard--whil
the
low
of
the
cattl
in
the
distanc
would
take
the
place
of
the
mock
turtl
heavi
sobs.
lastly,
she
pictur
to
herself
how
this
same
littl
sister
of
her
would,
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
keep,
through
all
her
riper
years,
the
simpl
and
love
heart
of
her
childhood:
and
how
she
would
gather
about
her
other
littl
children,
and
make
their
eye
bright
and
eager
with
mani
a
strang
tale,
perhap
even
with
the
dream
of
wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
feel
with
all
their
simpl
sorrows,
and
find
a
pleasur
in
all
their
simpl
joys,
rememb
her
own
child-life,
